Outline:

1) Research Question

 - Background:
 --The aim of the current study is to investigate whether MRI image features extracted from baseline kidney images can enhance the prediction of disease progression in young Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) patients. This study is warranted  because recent literature has demonstrated the inclusion of MRI image features improves the prognostic accuracy of models in adults, but this has not yet been demonstrated in children. Improving prediction models could greatly assist in diagnosing and predicting kidney disease outcomes in children, which is more challenging than in adults and could thereby lead to improved treatment.

- Clinical Hypotheses
--Including MRI image features will improve model performance when compared to using baseline kidney volume alone in models predicting: 
---1) Percentage change of height-corrected total kidney volume growth 
---2) Classification of a patient as having fast or slow progression of the disease


2) Data Overview

 - Population Description:
 --This data was collected on 71 young ADPKD patients at Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado at their preliminary visit and at their subsequent follow-up 3 years later
-- 4 patients were determined to be points of high leverage and influence and were removed as outliers [make room so I can add a picture here]
-- The presiding physician collected the height-corrected kidney volume for each patient at each visit
-- This information was used to calculate the percentage change in kidney volume over time and classify patients as having slow or fast disease progression
 
-MRI Image Features
--Image features were extracted from the baseline MRI images including 2 image features on kidney geometry, 5 features based on Gabor transform, 2 features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix, 5 features based on image textures, and 5 features based on local binary pattern

-Missingness
-- There were no missing values in this data set, thus missing data mechanisms did not need to be assessed

- Feature Engineering
-- Scatterplots were made to assess the relationship of each MRI image feature with the percentage change in total kidney volume. Additional square, average, and interaction terms were then created to attempt to uncover potential hidden underlying relationships and better capture potential non-linear relationships. [Leave room for me to add a picture here]

-Feature Selection.  
-- A correlation matrix was performed to assess which MRI image features were most strongly correlated with percentage change in total kidney volume and slow or fast disease progression. Individual univariate analyses (linear regression for total kidney volume, logistic regression for slow or fast disease progression) were then conducted to assess if each MRI image feature was a significant predictor of the target variables. To keep with the ‚ÄúRule of 10‚Äù, the top 5 most promising features were chosen for the final model.

- Feature Scaling
-- 5-fold cross validation was performed, and z-score normalization executed on the features of each training set. The mean and standard deviation of each training set was then used to normalize each respective test set using the caret package in R.

3) Analysis

- Predicting Height-Corrected Kidney Volume
-- H0: There will not be a significant difference in a linear regression between a model with both baseline kidney volume and MRI features, or a model solely with MRI image features, over and above a model with baseline kidney volume alone.
-- HA: There will be a significant difference between any model that contains MRI imaging features and a model with solely baseline volume.    

-Predicting Disease Progression Speed
-- H0: A logistic regression model predicting presence of fast disease progression including MRI image features and baseline kidney volume, or a model solely with MRI image features, will not have a statistically different performance than a model with baseline kidney volume alone.
-- HA:There will be a significant difference between any model that contains MRI imaging features and a model with solely baseline volume.       

- Models for Both Questions
-- Model A: $$ Kidney Volume Change = ùõΩ_0 + ùõΩ_{Log Kidney Volume Baseline} + e $$
-- Model B: $$ Kidney Volume Change = ùõΩ_0 + ùõΩ_{Txti2} + e $$
-- Model C: $$ Kidney Volume Change = ùõΩ_0 + ùõΩ_{1}*Baseline Kidney Volume + ùõΩ_{2}*Txti2 +  e $$

- Model Training
--  The ‚Äúcaret‚Äù package in R  was used to perform model training. Determination of best model performance used Root Mean Squared Error for Linear Regression and Area under the Curve (AUC) for Logistic Regression.

- Predicting Height-Corrected Kidney Volume
--To evaluate whether differences in model performance were statistically significant, RMSE for each model were compared using pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni correction for p-values. The differences in model performance were not statistically significant
