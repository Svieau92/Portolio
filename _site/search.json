    "text": "The aim of the current study is to investigate whether MRI image features extracted from baseline kidney images can enhance the prediction of disease progression in young Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) patients. This study is important because recent literature has demonstrated the inclusion of MRI image features improves the prognostic accuracy of models in adults, but this has not yet been demonstrated in children. Improving prediction models could greatly assist in diagnosing and predicting kidney disease outcomes in children, which is more challenging than in adults and could lead to improved treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two clinical hypotheses for this study are that including MRI image features will improve model performance compared to using baseline kidney volume alone in models predicting\n\nPercentage change of total kidney volume growth\nClassification of a patient as having fast or slow progression of the disease."

    "section": "Gabor Transform",
    "text": "Gabor Transform\n\nWhat is it\nThe Gabor Transform, named after Dennis Gabor, is a powerful technique for analyzing the texture of MRI images. By convolving the image with a Gabor filter, it becomes possible to discriminate between features based on intensity differences. This allows the target region and background to be differentiated if they possess distinct features, as they will exhibit different intensity levels. Moreover, the Gabor Transform has tunable parameters, such as the frequency of the sinusoidal wave, which can be adjusted to extract specific textures from the images. Higher frequencies are ideal for capturing fine textures, while lower frequencies are better suited for coarse textures.\n\n\nHow it Works\nThe Gabor Filter first applies a Gaussian Envelope to focus on a small region of the image. It then applies a sinusoidal wave that oscillates at a specific frequency and captures the variation in intensities at that frequency and orientation within that region.\n\n\nExample of Gabor Transform\n\n\n\nExample of applying a Gaussian, then Gabor, and Laplacian Filter (GGL) for differentiation between two different textures (+’s vs L’s) (2).\n\n\n\n\nImage Features Provided by the Gabor Transform\nIn general, Gabor functions can easily extract features of:\n\nSpatial Frequency (e.g. how often pixel intensity changes in a given area)\nDensity (e.g. concentration of features within a certain area)\nOrientation (e.g. Textures or edges at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°)\nPhase (e.g. alignment/distance of features)\nEnergy (e.g. overall intensity)\n\nSources: 1, 2"

    "text": "Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix\n\nWhat is it\nThe Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is another powerful tool for extracting texture features from an MRI image. GLCM works under the assumption that the textural information in an image is contained in the “average” spatial relationship that the gray tones in the image have to each other. For example, when a small patch of the picture has little variation of features, the dominant property is tone; When a small patch of a picture has high variation, the dominant property is texture (3).\n\n\nHow it Works\nGLCM examines the spatial relationship between pairs of pixels in an image and calculates how often pairs of pixel values occur at a specified distance and orientation. It does this by computing a set of gray-tone spacial-dependence matrices for various angular relationships and distances between neighboring resolution cell pairs on the image (3).\n\n\nExample of GLCM\n\n\n\nExample of textural features extracted from two different land-use category images (3).\n\n\n\n\nImage Features Provided by GLCM\nIn general, GLCM provides information on the following features:\n\nHomogeneity\nLinear Structure\nContrast\nNumber and Nature of Boundaries\nComplexity of the Image"

    "text": "Local Binary Pattern\n\nWhat is it\nThe Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a third powerful method for extracting texture features from an image. An important and fundamental property of texture is how uniform the patterns are, and LBP captures this by detecting these uniform patterns in circular neighborhoods at any rotation and spatial resolution. LBP is rotation invariant, meaning it does not matter what rotation the image is at; it will always extract very similar features) (4).\n\n\nHow it Works\nLBP works by comparing the intensity of a central pixel with its neighboring pixels and encoding this relationship into a binary pattern. For each neighbor, if it’s intensity is greater or equal to the central pixel, it gets assigned a 1 (otherwise a 0). The binary values of all neighbors are then concatenated to form a binary number, and this number is converted into a decimal that represent the LBP for the central pixel (4).\n\n\nExample of LBP\n\n\n\nExample of the 36 unique comparisons that can be made between neighboring pixels (4).\n\n\n\n\nCode Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Features Provided by the LBP\nIn general, the LBP provides image features on:\n\nUniformity\nLocal Contrast\nTexture Description\nSpatial Patterns\nGray Level Distribution"

Additionally, the height corrected kidney volume for each patient was collected at baseline and 3 years by a physician, and the percentage change calculated. Patients were classified as having slow or fast progression of the disease based on this percentage change. Image features were extracted from the baseline MRI images including 2 image features on kidney geometric information, 5 features based on Gabor transform, 2 features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix, 5 features based on image textures, and 5 features based on local binary pattern.\n\nStatistical Hypotheses\n\nA linear regression model predicting percentage change of total kidney volume growth including MRI image features and baseline kidney volume will have better performance than a model with baseline kidney volume alone, as determined by specificity, sensitivity, PPV,  NPV,  accuracy, and AUC.\nA logistic regression model predicting classification of disease progression as slow or fast including MRI image features and baseline kidney volume will have better performance than a model with baseline kidney volume alone, as determined by specificity, sensitivity, PPV,  NPV,  accuracy, and AUC."

Model A had an RMSE that was 0.37 points higher than model B (p = 0.68), and 0.74 points higher than model C (p = 0.75). This may be due to small sample size however.\nThus, including MRI image features into the predictive model did not increase predictive capability above and beyond that of just using kidney volume measurements at baseline.\nOn the other hand, if it is true that a model with baseline kidney volume, a model with txti2 alone, and a model with both included all perform similarly at predicting percent change in kidney volume after 3 years, then this could provide support for predicting change in kidney volume percent by EITHER MRI image features or baseline kidney volume.\nThat is, utilizing MRI image features alone may offer similar predictive capabilities to using kidney volume measurements taken by a practiced physician. Therefore, if one is easier or cheaper than the other to acquire, the easier alternative could be used in place of the harder alternative and still achieve similar predictive power. For example, if there are MRI records but perhaps kidney volume measurements were not taken, then the MRI images can be used instead for making predictions."

    "section": "Project Description",
    "text": "Project Description\n\nBackground\n             The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a MICU physical therapy (PT) quality improvement (QI) project on physical therapist practice, and quantify the changes in length of stay (LOS) and mechanical ventilation (MV) time. The goals of the QI Initiative were to increase percentage of MICU admissions receiving PT, decrease time from MICU admission to first PT, and increase the frequency of PT visits. The main question the researcher came to us with was: how to correctly model the longitudinal data in the study?\n\n\nStudy Design\n              This was a retrospective cohort study, comparing 3 main time periods: Pre-QI Initiative (before April 2015), During QI Initiative (April 2015-Dec 2015), and After-QI Initiative (Jan 2016 and later). The QI initiative was deployed during the 9-month period between April 2015 and December 2015, during which time there were education and staffing changes. Patients were stratified as either having mechanical ventilation or not having mechanical ventilation. The primary outcomes of interest were MICU LOS and time on MV. Secondary outcomes of interest were the non-ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and discharge location.\n\n\nDescription of the Data\n              Data was received as a de-identified .csv. Data points consist of: Admit and Discharge Time, PT Consult Time, Admit to Consult Time, First Therapy Time, Consult to Therapy Time, Admit to Therapy Time, Total Therapy Visits, Days with Therapy Visits, Average, min, and Max Therapy Length, Admit and Discharge Date/Time, Total MV Days, Hospital LOS, Patient Age, Sex, “Problem List”, and Codes (presumably ICD9/10).\n\n\nAnticipated Sample Size / Study Population\n              The sample size is N = ~3000-4000, consisting of patients admitted to the MICU with a LOS between 2 and 30 days (I.e. exclude &lt; 2 days or &gt; 30 days). This was a single site study performed here at Colorado University.\n\n\nHypothesis\n              The hypothesis for the study was that LOS and time on MV would decrease when comparing the pre- and intra-initiative time periods, and when comparing the pre- and post-initiative time periods. Clinical significance for this outcome is considered as a 1-2 day change in LOS. The intended end product of this project is a publication in a PT journal.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan (Sketch)\n              Data should first be examined for missingness, as this has not been performed. Similarly, repeat MICU admissions should be explored and controlled for to ensure independence of observations. Death during MICU stay should also be examined and adjusted for if needed. The analysis plan discussed was to utilize splines to capture the trajectory of LOS or time on MV over time by fitting smooth curves to the data. Linear contrasts should be performed to assess if there is a significant difference in LOS or time on MV when comparing two timepoints (i.e. pre- and intra-, pre- and post- , and post- and intra-QI Initiative. Supplementary analyses should be performed to assess secondary outcomes of interest of non-ICU LOS and total hospital LOS."

    "section": "Project Description",
    "text": "Project Description\n\nBackground\n             The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a MICU physical therapy (PT) quality improvement (QI) project on physical therapist practice, and quantify the changes in length of stay (LOS) and mechanical ventilation (MV) time. The goals of the QI Initiative were to increase percentage of MICU admissions receiving PT, decrease time from MICU admission to first PT, and increase the frequency of PT visits. The main question the researcher came to us with was: how to correctly model the longitudinal data in the study?\n\n\nStudy Design\n              This was a retrospective cohort study, comparing 3 main time periods: Pre-QI Initiative (before April 2015), During QI Initiative (April 2015-Dec 2015), and After-QI Initiative (Jan 2016 and later). The QI initiative was deployed during the 9-month period between April 2015 and December 2015, during which time there were education and staffing changes. Patients were stratified as either having mechanical ventilation or not having mechanical ventilation. The primary outcomes of interest were MICU LOS and time on MV. Secondary outcomes of interest were the non-ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and discharge location.\n\n\nDescription of the Data\n              Data was received as a de-identified .csv. Data points consist of: Admit and Discharge Time, PT Consult Time, Admit to Consult Time, First Therapy Time, Consult to Therapy Time, Admit to Therapy Time, Total Therapy Visits, Days with Therapy Visits, Average, min, and Max Therapy Length, Admit and Discharge Date/Time, Total MV Days, Hospital LOS, Patient Age, Sex, “Problem List”, and Codes (presumably ICD9/10).\n\n\nAnticipated Sample Size / Study Population\n              The sample size is N = ~3000-4000, consisting of patients admitted to the MICU with a LOS between 2 and 30 days (I.e. exclude &lt; 2 days or &gt; 30 days). This was a single site study performed here at Colorado University.\n\n\nHypothesis\n              The hypothesis for the study was that LOS and time on MV would decrease when comparing the pre- and intra-initiative time periods, and when comparing the pre- and post-initiative time periods. Clinical significance for this outcome is considered as a 1-2 day change in LOS. The intended end product of this project is a publication in a PT journal.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan (Sketch)\n              Data should first be examined for missingness, as this has not been performed. Similarly, repeat MICU admissions should be explored and controlled for to ensure independence of observations. Death during MICU stay should also be examined and adjusted for if needed. The analysis plan discussed was to utilize splines to capture the trajectory of LOS or time on MV over time by fitting smooth curves to the data. Linear contrasts should be performed to assess if there is a significant difference in LOS or time on MV when comparing two timepoints (i.e. pre- and intra-, pre- and post- , and post- and intra-QI Initiative. Supplementary analyses should be performed to assess secondary outcomes of interest of non-ICU LOS and total hospital LOS."

The researchers are interested in comparing subjects who never used hard drugs to current hard drug users (those that use hard drugs at year 2) or previous hard drug users (those who used drugs at year 0 or 1). Outcomes of interest are: viral load (HIV copies in a mL of blood), CD4+ T cell count (a measure of immunologic health), and aggregate physical and quality of life scores from the SF-36.\nThe clinical hypothesis is that, if hard drugs inhibit the immune system in humans, subjects who currently or previously used hard drugs will have higher viral load and lower CD4+ T cell counts than those who never used hard drugs. Additionally, the researchers are interested in knowing if potential differences between the drug use groups can be explained by differences in adherence to the treatment regimen. The researchers are agnostic on how quality of life changes after treatment, since side effects of the treatment are significant.\nThe project description provided by the PI is available below:"

Under this model hard drug use and adherence are not significant predictors of mental QOL. This is because depression is a confounder.\nI will therefore include the model with depression and the interaction term, so we can still investigate the main research question.\nTherefore model_MENT1 is the final model.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n# Create the data set for mental QOL\ndata_MENT &lt;- data_2 |&gt; \n  select(newid, AGG_MENT, hard_drugs_grp, ADH_HIGHVSLOW, years, CESD) %&gt;%\n  filter(complete.cases(.))\n\n# Change reference level\ndata_MENT$hard_drugs_grp &lt;- relevel(data_MENT$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Never User\")\n\n# Create LMM\nmodel_MENT1 &lt;- lme(AGG_MENT ~ hard_drugs_grp + years + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + hard_drugs_grp*years + CESD,\n                   random = list(newid = pdSymm(~ years)), \n                   data = data_MENT)\n\n# Get model summary\nsummary(model_MENT1)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: data_MENT \n       AIC      BIC    logLik\n  10848.59 10913.16 -5412.294\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~years | newid\n Structure: General positive-definite\n            StdDev    Corr  \n(Intercept) 4.3455421 (Intr)\nyears       0.3717221 -1    \nResidual    6.0377346       \n\nFixed effects:  AGG_MENT ~ hard_drugs_grp + years + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + hard_drugs_grp *      years + CESD \n                                     Value Std.Error   DF   t-value p-value\n(Intercept)                       57.87606 0.4190797 1059 138.10276  0.0000\nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User        0.78568 1.0942518  546   0.71801  0.4731\nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User        -2.27986 0.9972527  546  -2.28614  0.0226\nyears                              0.30811 0.2073133 1059   1.48621  0.1375\nADH_HIGHVSLOWLow Adherence         0.85071 0.7612683  546   1.11749  0.2643\nCESD                              -0.91187 0.0180253 1059 -50.58831  0.0000\nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User:years -0.36332 0.6647696 1059  -0.54654  0.5848\nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User:years   1.69469 0.6106482 1059   2.77524  0.0056\n Correlation: \n                                  (Intr) hr__PU hr__CU years  ADH_HA CESD  \nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User       -0.184                                   \nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User        -0.291  0.100                            \nyears                             -0.581  0.193  0.225                     \nADH_HIGHVSLOWLow Adherence        -0.142 -0.014  0.021 -0.006              \nCESD                              -0.569 -0.104  0.029  0.091 -0.068       \nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User:years  0.159 -0.657 -0.069 -0.308 -0.001  0.011\nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User:years   0.230 -0.060 -0.679 -0.345  0.008 -0.089\n                                  h__PU:\nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User             \nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User              \nyears                                   \nADH_HIGHVSLOWLow Adherence              \nCESD                                    \nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User:years       \nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User:years   0.104\n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n        Min          Q1         Med          Q3         Max \n-3.44300701 -0.46895838  0.05349899  0.54923036  4.31899276 \n\nNumber of Observations: 1613\nNumber of Groups: 550 \n\n# Get 95% CI's\nintervals(model_MENT1, which = \"fixed\")\n\nApproximate 95% confidence intervals\n\n Fixed effects:\n                                        lower       est.      upper\n(Intercept)                       57.05373769 57.8760586 58.6983795\nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User       -1.36377666  0.7856821  2.9351409\nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User        -4.23878095 -2.2798591 -0.3209373\nyears                             -0.09867992  0.3081115  0.7149030\nADH_HIGHVSLOWLow Adherence        -0.64466145  0.8507117  2.3460849\nCESD                              -0.94723782 -0.9118685 -0.8764992\nhard_drugs_grpPrevious User:years -1.66773753 -0.3633223  0.9410929\nhard_drugs_grpCurrent User:years   0.49647472  1.6946926  2.8929104\n\n\nAfter controlling for adherence and between subject means (intercepts), there was no difference in average mental QOL between previous and current hard drug users (p = 0.47, 95% CI: -1.36, 2.94).

On average, current hard drug users had a 1.69 point increase in physical QOL per year compared to never drug users (p = 0.056, 95% CI: 0.50, 2.89). The slope for physical QOL over time did not differ between never and previous users (p = 0.58, 95% CI: -1.67, 0.94). On average, current hard drug users had a 2.06 point increase in mental QOL compared to previous users (p = 0.016, 95% CI: 0.38, 3.73).\n\n\nTime\nThere was a significant no change in mental QOL over time while controlling for subject-specific means, hard drug use, and adherence, with an average increase of 0.31 points per year (p 0.14, 95% CI: -0.099, 0.71).\n\n\nDepression\nControlling for adherence, hard drug use, and time, depression was a significant predictor of mental QOL. On average, mental QOL score decreased by 0.91 points for every 1 point increase in depression score (p &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: -0.95, -0.88).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nLet’s examine the main interaction for physical QOL by hard drug use group over time.\n\n# Get fitted values for plotting\ndata_MENT &lt;- data_MENT %&gt;%\n  mutate(fitted = predict(model_MENT1))\n\n# Plot the interaction\nggplot(data_MENT, aes(x = years, y = fitted, color = hard_drugs_grp)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Predicted Mental QOL over Years by Hard Drug Use\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Predicted Mental QOL\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Pastel2\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see the main effect that current users had lower mental QOL compared to previous and never users. The slopes were significantly different between current and previous users, but this was likely not significant following correction for pairwise comparisons."

This difference was not statistically significant between current and previous users, although it looks like it should be.\nThat is, current drug users had more of a decline in physical QOL over time compared to previous and current drug users.\nLet’s then examine the interaction for adherence over time.\n\n# Plot the interaction\nggplot(data_PHYS, aes(x = years, y = fitted, color = ADH_HIGHVSLOW)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Predicted Physical QOL over Years by Adherence\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Predicted Physical QOL\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Pastel2\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, we can see the main interaction here: those with low adherence had a steeper slope compared to those with high adherence. That is, if a patient had low adherence, they had more of a decline in physical QOL compared to those with high adherence."

    "text": "The aim of the current study is to assess whether a new gel treatment for gum disease results in lower whole-mouth average pocket depth and attachment loss after one year. Average pocket depth and attachment loss were taken at baseline, and participants were assigned into one of five groups (1 = placebo, 2 = no treatment, 3 = low concentration, 4 = medium concentration, 5 = high concentration) and instructed to apply the gel to their gums twice a day. After 1-year, average pocket depth and attachment loss were recorded again. Data was received as a .csv file containing treatment level, average pocket depth and attachment loss at baseline and at one-year, demographic information, gender, age, number of sites measured, and smoking status. The clinical hypothesis is that average pocket depth and attachment loss in participants who applied the gel will be lower compared to participants who did not. Gender, age, ethnicity, and smoking status will be investigated as potential covariates.\nThe project description provided by the PI is available below:\n\n\nThis document was created in RStudio with Quarto.\nTo code in SAS we must first connect RStudio to the SAS server.\n\n# This code connects to SAS On Demand\nlibrary(configSAS)\nconfigSAS::set_sas_engine()\n\nUsing SAS Config named: oda\nSAS Connection established.

Attachment loss change is slightly left-tailed but this could be due to outliers, or may just not impact the analysis.\nBack to top of tabset"

Additionally, there does not seem to be a difference between the treatment groups and the placebo for attachment loss change.\n\n\nPocket Depth Change\nInterestingly, the high concentration condition appears to have had a negative effect. Additionally, there seems to be a difference in the treatment groups compared to the no treatment control, but NOT when compared to the placebo.

However, since this was a placebo-controlled RCT, and none of the treatment groups were significantly different from the placebo group, we can conclude that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the average attachment loss over 1 year is the same between all groups.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\n\nNow we will create our model with pocket depth change as the dependent variable and treatment group as the independent variable.\n\n* Simple Linear Regression Predicting Pocket Depth Change by Treatment Condition;\nTITLE \"SLR of Pocket Depth Change by Treatment Condition - Control as Reference\";\nPROC REG DATA = Proj1.data;\n    MODEL pdchange = placebo low medium high;\n    RUN;\n\nlstlog\n\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLR of Pocket Depth Change by Treatment Condition - Control as Reference\n\n\n\n\nThe REG Procedure\n\n\nModel: MODEL1\n\n\nDependent Variable: pdchange Pocket Depth Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations Read\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations Used\n\n\n103\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations with Missing Values\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nDF\n\n\nSum ofSquares\n\n\nMeanSquare\n\n\nF Value\n\n\nPr &gt; F\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.57020\n\n\n0.14255\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n0.0899\n\n\n\n\nError\n\n\n98\n\n\n6.73457\n\n\n0.06872\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCorrected Total\n\n\n102\n\n\n7.30477\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot MSE\n\n\n0.26215\n\n\nR-Square\n\n\n0.0781\n\n\n\n\nDependent Mean\n\n\n-0.29435\n\n\nAdj R-Sq\n\n\n0.0404\n\n\n\n\nCoeff Var\n\n\n-89.05770\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Estimates\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nLabel\n\n\nDF\n\n\nParameterEstimate\n\n\nStandardError\n\n\nt Value\n\n\nPr &gt; |t|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n\n\nIntercept\n\n\n1\n\n\n-0.33817\n\n\n0.05466\n\n\n-6.19\n\n\n&lt;.0001\n\n\n\n\nplacebo\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n-0.01152\n\n\n0.07730\n\n\n-0.15\n\n\n0.8818\n\n\n\n\nlow\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.13200\n\n\n0.07912\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n0.0984\n\n\n\n\nmedium\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.13562\n\n\n0.08015\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n0.0938\n\n\n\n\nhigh\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n-0.04413\n\n\n0.08534\n\n\n-0.52\n\n\n0.6063\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLR of Pocket Depth Change by Treatment Condition - Control as Reference\n\n\n\n\nThe REG Procedure\n\n\nModel: MODEL1\n\n\nDependent Variable: pdchange Pocket Depth Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u001455                                                         The SAS System                    Thursday, November 28, 2024 06:14:00 AM\n\n558        ods listing close;ods html5 (id=saspy_internal) file=_tomods1 options(bitmap_mode='inline') device=svg style=HTMLBlue;\n558      ! ods graphics on / outputfmt=png;\n559        \n560        * Simple Linear Regression Predicting Pocket Depth Change by Treatment Condition;\n561        TITLE \"SLR of Pocket Depth Change by Treatment Condition - Control as Reference\";\n562        PROC REG DATA = Proj1.data;\n563         MODEL pdchange = placebo low medium high;\n564         RUN;\n565        \n566        \n567        ods html5 (id=saspy_internal) close;ods listing;\n568        \n\u001456                                                         The SAS System                    Thursday, November 28, 2024 06:14:00 AM\n\n569        \n\n\n\n\nThe overall model is not statistically significant (F(4,98)= 2.074, p = 0.0899).

That is, we needed to prove that we were capturing real voltage signals.\nOne approach to this problem was to perform voltage imaging with a GEVI in the motor cortex and correlate that activity to a physiological indicator of movement - mice walking on a treadmill. The idea is simple: If we were capturing true voltage signals, we would see spikes every time the mice walked.\nThus, we created a paradigm where we could image mice while they walked on a treadmill. (This experimental set-up would also allow for further experiments down the road of particular interest to my lab, such as documenting the relationships between inhibitory interneurons during locomotion).\nThis experimental set up can be seen here."

This resulted in treadmill files that were capturing data when the camera was turned off at both at the beginning and end of each treadmill file.\nThis can be visualized here.\n\n\n\nThus, the treadmill data would have to be cleaned in order for the treadmill and camera recordings to be synchronized with each other."

    "text": "The aim of the current study is to assess whether a new gel treatment for gum disease results in lower whole-mouth average pocket depth and attachment loss after one year. Average pocket depth and attachment loss were taken at baseline, and participants were assigned into one of five groups (1 = placebo, 2 = no treatment, 3 = low concentration, 4 = medium concentration, 5 = high concentration) and instructed to apply the gel to their gums twice a day. After 1-year, average pocket depth and attachment loss were recorded again. Data was received as a .csv file containing treatment level, average pocket depth and attachment loss at baseline and at one-year, demographic information, gender, age, number of sites measured, and smoking status. The clinical hypothesis is that average pocket depth and attachment loss in participants who applied the gel will be lower compared to participants who did not. Gender, age, ethnicity, and smoking status will be investigated as potential covariates.\nThe project description provided by the PI is available below:\n\n\n\nFirst we begin by loading in the necessary packages\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra) # This lets me pretty print the tables\nlibrary(naniar) # Used to visualize missing data\nlibrary(glue) # This is used for f-strings in R\nlibrary(purrr) # Used for summary tables\nlibrary(corrplot) # Used to make the correlation matrix\nlibrary(corrtable) # used to make the table for the correlation matrix\nlibrary(xtable) # Used to make the table for the correlation matrix\nlibrary(htmlTable) # Used to make Table 1\nlibrary(boot) # Used to make Table 1\nlibrary(table1) # Used to make Table 1\nlibrary(sjPlot) # Used to generate publication quality tables for regressions\nlibrary(mice) # Used for multiple imputation\nlibrary(car) # Used for outlier diagnostics with jackknife residuals\n\nThen we will import the dataset\n\n# Import dataset\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\sviea\\\\Documents\\\\Advanced Data Analysis\\\\Project 1 MLR with Covariates\\\\Project1_data.csv\")\nnames(data)[1] &lt;- \"id\" # Renaming the weird character out of this colname\n\nAnd visualize the dataset\n\n# Create a nicely formatted table, code adapted from ChatGPT\nkable(head(data), format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\nid\ntrtgroup\ngender\nrace\nage\nsmoker\nsites\nattachbase\nattach1year\npdbase\npd1year\n\n\n\n\n101\n4\n2\n5\n44.57221\n1\n162\n2.432099\n2.577640\n3.246914\n3.407407\n\n\n102\n5\n2\n5\n35.57290\n1\n162\n2.543210\nNA\n3.006173\nNA\n\n\n103\n2\n2\n5\n47.94524\n1\n144\n2.881944\n3.076389\n3.118056\n3.125000\n\n\n104\n3\n2\n5\n55.17864\n1\n138\n4.956522\n5.304348\n5.217391\n4.891304\n\n\n105\n1\n2\n2\n43.79740\n1\n168\n1.773810\n1.452381\n3.363095\n2.898810\n\n\n106\n4\n2\n5\n42.14921\n1\n168\n2.369048\n1.922619\n3.910714\n3.083333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Acquire number of variables and observations of the data set\ndim(data)\n\n[1] 130  11\n\n\nOur data set is comprised of 130 observations, with 11 variables\n\n\nThe variables in the provided data set are as follows:\n\nid: Patient ID\ntrtgroup: Treatment group (1 = placebo, 2 = no treatment control, 3 = low concentration, 4 = medium concentration, 5 = high concentration gel)\ngender: Gender (1 = male, 2 = female)\nrace: Race, (1 = Native American, 2 = African American, 3 = Not used, 4 = Asian, 5 = White)\nage: Age in years\nsmoker: Smoking status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\nsites: Number of sites gum measurements were averaged from\nattachbase: Whole-mouth average attachment loss taken at base timepoint\nattach1year: Whole-mouth average attachment loss after 1 year\npdbase: Whole-mouth average pocket loss at base timepoint\npd1year: Whole-mouth average pocket loss after 1 year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPocket depth and attachment loss are both measurements of how far the gums have pulled away from the teeth, hence smaller values are better"

Let’s investigate that in the next tab.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nThere is a correlation between gender and ID. Let’s make a simple plot to investigate.\n\n# Creating a simple plot of id and gender\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(gender), y = id)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(title = \"ID by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, it appears that the experimenters assigned ID based on gender. That is, females received ID’s starting at 101, and males received ID’s starting at 201 (for some reason there’s a few females with ID’s &gt; 200).\nIt will be important to double check with the PI’s how they assigned participants to treatment group to ensure it was in fact random.\nLet’s make a contingency table to see what the breakdown between gender and treatment group is.\n\n# First make a contingency table of both variables\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(data_missing$gender, data_missing$trtgroup)\n\n# Set the row and column names\ndimnames(contingency_table) &lt;- list(\n  \"Gender\" = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n  \"Treatment Condition\" = c(\"Placebo\", \"Control\", \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))\n\n# Convert the table to a dataframe for better formatting (from ChatGPT)\ncontingency_df &lt;- as.data.frame.matrix(contingency_table)\n\n# Pretty print the table using kable\nkable(contingency_df, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo\nControl\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nMale\n10\n7\n9\n7\n3\n\n\nFemale\n13\n16\n12\n13\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not good! It looks like males were less likely to be in the high treatment condition compared to females.\nThis could be because males were more likely to drop out then females. Let’s make a quick table using the original data set before we dropped the missing variables.\n\n# First make a contingency table of both variables\ncontingency_table_clean &lt;- table(data$gender, data$trtgroup)\n\n# Set the row and column names\ndimnames(contingency_table_clean) &lt;- list(\n  \"Gender\" = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n  \"Treatment Condition\" = c(\"Placebo\", \"Control\", \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))\n\n# Convert the table to a dataframe for better formatting (from ChatGPT)\ncontingency_df_clean &lt;- as.data.frame.matrix(contingency_table_clean)\n\n# Pretty print the table using kable\nkable(contingency_df_clean, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo\nControl\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nMale\n11\n10\n11\n11\n11\n\n\nFemale\n15\n16\n15\n15\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks more balanced before I took out participants with missing data.\nChi-square is known to be unsuitable if a cell has &lt; 5 counts, which we have in this case (3 males in high concentration condition). So I will run Fisher’s test to see if that difference is statistically significant.\n\nfisher_test &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nfisher_test\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.506\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nThe p-value is not signficant (p = 0.506).\nWe know from visualizing the missing data that there were 27 missing data points for the gum measurement DVs, and these all belong to the same people. Furthermore, it appears that males in the treatment groups were more likely to have missing values than in the placebo (and maybe control) group. Is it possible that the gel was having an adverse effect on these participants? Does the gel have an adverse effect only on males and not females for some reason? Let’s explore.\nFirst, I want to investigate if males were more likely to have missing data points. It’s possible if their gums were hurting they simply rejected or avoided having these measurements taken.\nLet’s repeat this process and make a contingency table of gender and missing variables.\n\n# First let's add a new dummy code for if a participant is missing any data points\ndata$missing &lt;- ifelse(apply(data, 1, function(row) any(is.na(row))), 1, 0)\n\n# First make a contingency table of both variables\ncontingency_table_missing &lt;- table(data$gender, data$missing)\n\n# Set the row and column names\ndimnames(contingency_table_missing) &lt;- list(\n  \"Gender\" = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n  \"Missing\" = c(\"Not Missing\", \"Missing\"))\n\n# Convert the table to a dataframe for better formatting (from ChatGPT)\ncontingency_df_missing &lt;- as.data.frame.matrix(contingency_table_missing)\n\n# Pretty print the table using kable\nkable(contingency_df_missing, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Missing\nMissing\n\n\n\n\nMale\n35\n19\n\n\nFemale\n66\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportionally, it appears that males may be more likely to have missing variables than females. Let’s run a chi-square to check.\n\nchi_square_test &lt;- chisq.test(contingency_df_missing)\nchi_square_test\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  contingency_df_missing\nX-squared = 7.6127, df = 1, p-value = 0.005796\n\n\nSuccess! Males were more likely to have missing values compared to females (p = 0.005796). This could be a problem (counfound) if something was causing males to avoid having their gums measured compared to females (such as adverse reactions from the gel)\nLet’s do a quick chi square test to check if there is a relationship between missing values and treatment condition.\nWe start off the same way by making a contingency table and running a chi-square test.\n\n# First make a contingency table of both variables\ncontingency_table_missing2 &lt;- table(data$missing, data$trtgroup)\n\n# Set the row and column names\ndimnames(contingency_table_missing2) &lt;- list(\"Missing\" = c(\"Not Missing\", \"Missing\"),\n                                             \"Treatmtent Condition\" = c(\"Placebo\", \"Control\", \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))\n\n# Convert the table to a dataframe for better formatting (from ChatGPT)\ncontingency_df_missing2 &lt;- as.data.frame.matrix(contingency_table_missing2)\n\n# Pretty print the table using kable\nkable(contingency_df_missing2, format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo\nControl\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nNot Missing\n22\n23\n21\n19\n16\n\n\nMissing\n4\n3\n5\n7\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt does appear that there are more missing variables in the high concentration condition. Is it statistically significant?\n\n# Run a Fisher's Exact Test (since we have &lt; 5 observations in cells)\nfisher_test &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_df_missing2)\nfisher_test\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_df_missing2\np-value = 0.1675\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nNot significant (p = 0.1675). So we can conclude that there is no difference in gender or missing values based on treatment condition (i.e., participants in all treatment conditions were equally likely to be male or female, or have missing values)\nHowever, across the board, males were more likely to have missing values than females. This will be important to note as a caveat during interpretation of the final results.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nHere we will simply plot the histograms of attachment loss and pocket depth changes scores, to assess if they appear normally distributed or if we will have to perform a transformation of some kind.\n\n# Plot simple histogram of attachment loss change score\nhist(data_missing$attachchange,\n     main  = \"Histogram of Attachment Loss Change\",\n     xlab = \"Attachment Loss Change\",\n     ylab = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot simple histogram of pocket depth change score\nhist(data_missing$pdchange,\n     main  = \"Histogram of Attachment Loss Change\",\n     xlab = \"Pocket Depth Change\",\n     ylab = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth attachment loss and pocket depth change appear to be normally distributed and will not need to be transformed. Attachment loss change is slightly left-tailed but this could be due to outliers, or may just not impact the analysis."

Additionally, there does not seem to be a difference between the treatment groups and the placebo for attachment loss change.\nPocket Depth Change\nInterestingly, the high concentration condition appears to have had a negative effect. Additionally, there seems to be a difference in the treatment groups compared to the no treatment control, but NOT when compared to the placebo. The exception is the low concentration condition compared to the placebo when looking at pocket depth change. Further analysis will reveal whether these differences are statistically significant or not.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nThe relationship between low vs medium vs high gel concentration does not look very strong. Furthermore, we technically do not have a large enough sample size in the high concentration condition to include it.\nFor those reasons, let’s make the same comparisons but while combining all treatment levels into one group called treatment.\n\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(trt3groups), y = attachchange)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(trt3groups), y = attachchange)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Attachment Loss Change by Treatment\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(trt3groups), y = pdchange)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Pocket Depth Change by Treatment\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy eye, it appears as if there is no difference between the placebo and collapsed treatment groups in attachment loss change or pocket depth change. However, both placebo and any treatment conditions appear to have decreased (?) attachment loss and pocket depth. It may be that this study has null results, unless including one of the covariates changes the results. We will see come the analysis section.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will exlore the relationships between our potential covariates and attachment loss and pocket depth change\n\nAgeSitesGenderRaceSmoking Status\n\n\n\n# Plot age vs attachment loss change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = age, y = attachchange)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Age vs Attachment Loss Change\")\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot age vs pocket depth change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = age, y = pdchange)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Age vs Pocket Depth Change\")\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere does not appear to be any kind of linear relationship between age and attachment loss change or pocket depth change. I will run a model where I include age, but it will likely be removed in the final model.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nIs there any relationship between the number of sites measured from and attachment loss change or pocket depth change (e.g. a lower number of sites could lead to less accurate readings)? If so this could be something to include in our data analysis\n\n# Plot sites vs attachment change loss\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = sites, y = attachchange)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Attachment Loss Change vs Sites\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot sites vs pocket depth chagne\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = sites, y = pdchange)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Pocket Depth Change by Sites\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be a dramatic difference in attachment loss or pocket depth change based on the number of sites measured from. It’s a bit hard to tell with those two low site subjects, but the points are similar enough to the rest of the dataset that I do not think we have to worry about site number in our analysis.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nIt is conceivable that there are sex differences in regards to gum health. Let’s examine if there is a difference in attachment loss or pocket depth change based on gender\n\n# Plot gender vs attachment loss change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(gender), y = attachchange)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Attachment Loss Change by Gender\",\n      x = \"Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot gender vs pocket depth change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(gender), y = pdchange)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Pocket Depth Change by Gender\",\n      x = \"Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy eye, it appears that males may have more pocket depth loss compared with females. This will be a good variable to include as a covariate.\nLet’s try a t-test to see if there is any difference in attachment loss or pocket depth change based on gender\n\n# Running a t-test on attachment loss change by gender\nmale &lt;- data_missing$attachchange[data_missing$gender == 1]\nfemale &lt;- data_missing$attachchange[data_missing$gender == 2]\nt_test_result &lt;- t.test(male, female)\nt_test_result\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  male and female\nt = 2.1969, df = 100.8, p-value = 0.03032\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.01003279 0.19682842\nsample estimates:\n  mean of x   mean of y \n-0.03217094 -0.13560154 \n\n\nThere is a significant difference in attachment loss change score based on gender (t = 2.0502, p = 0.04299)\nLet’s repeat for pocket depth change\n\n# Running a t-test on pocket depth change by gender\nmale &lt;- data_missing$pdchange[data_missing$gender == 1]\nfemale &lt;- data_missing$pdchange[data_missing$gender == 2]\nt_test_result &lt;- t.test(male, female)\nt_test_result\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  male and female\nt = 2.3534, df = 81.683, p-value = 0.02101\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.01884469 0.22488042\nsample estimates:\n mean of x  mean of y \n-0.2150844 -0.3369470 \n\n\nThere is also a statistically significant difference in pocket depth change based on gender (t = 2.2626, p = 0.02641).\nTherefore I will include gender as a covariate in the analysis!\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\n\n# Plot race vs attachment loss change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(race), y = attachchange)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Attachment Change by Race\",\n       x = \"Race\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(race), y = pdchange)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Pocket Depth Change by Race\",\n  x = \"Race\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be much of a difference in attachment loss or pocket depth based on race. MAYBE African Americans (2) have more pocket depth loss compared to Asians(4), but the sample size was very small for both races (88.1% of the sample identified as White)\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nWhether the participant is a smoker or not likely has a dramatic effect on gum health. Let’s assess\n\n# Plot smoking status vs attachment loss change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(smoker), y = attachchange)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Attachment loss by smoking status\",\n       x = \"Smoking Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot smoking status vs pocket depth change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = factor(smoker), y = pdchange)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Attachment loss by smoking status\",\n       x = \"Smoking Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere does not appear to be any difference in attachment loss or pocket depth change based on smoking status. I will test a model with smoking status included, but it will likely be dropped in the final model.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline vs 1 YearAttachment Loss vs Pocket Depth\n\n\nI am curious what the relationship between base line and 1 year measurements are. The study is an RCT so even if baseline measurements affect 1 year measurements, participants should have been randomly assigned to groups so it is essentially controlled for in the study design. It will still be important to assess this relationship as a moderator however. Maybe treatment only worked for those with high attachment loss or pocket depth at the beginning?\nFirst let’s make a simple plot of attachment loss at baseline and at 1 year\n\n# Creating a scatter plot of attachment loss at baseline and 1 year\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = attachbase, y = attach1year)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Attachment Loss at Baseline and 1 Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the correlation coefficient.\n\n# Run a correlation test between attachment at base and 1 year\ncorrelation &lt;- cor.test(data_missing$attachbase, data_missing$attach1year)\ncorrelation\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  data_missing$attachbase and data_missing$attach1year\nt = 29.198, df = 101, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.9204657 0.9628839\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.9455558 \n\n\nThose are highly correlated (R = 0.946, p &lt;.0001)!

This is important! We should account for attachment loss at baseline by including it as a covariate in our final model!\nLet’s do the same process of pocket depth at baseline and 1 year\n\n# Create a scatterplot of pocket depth at base vs 1 year\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = pdbase, y = pd1year)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Pocket Depth at Baseline and 1 Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to attachment loss, we see a relationship between pocket depth at baseline and 1 year.

We should also therefore include pocket depth at baseline as a covariate in our model to control for it!\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nI am interested in how attachment loss and pocket depth change are related. Since they are both measurements taken from the same sites in the gums, they are likely to be highly correlated. This could have implications on how we perform the analysis and interpret the results.\nFirst, we plot attachment loss change against pocket depth change\n\n# Creating a scatter plot of attachment loss change against pocket depth change \nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = attachchange, y = pdchange)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Attachment Loss Change and Pocket Depth Change\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks like a linear relationship!

The simple linear regression shows that pocket depth change significantly predicts attachment loss change (t = 6.37, p &lt;.0001).\nHowever, multicollinearity is only an issue when IVs are correlated with each other. We can still run a multivariate multiple linear regression even though the DVs are correlated. In fact this is often the case, and is one of the justifications for using a multivariate MLR in the first place! Back to top of tabset\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Condition\nCollapsing the low, medium, and high concentration gel groups into 1 group does not seem to improve the relationship between treatment and attachment loss or pocket depth change. Only models including all 5 treatment groups will therefore be considered from here on out to keep in alignment with the original study design.\nGender\nGender is related to attachment loss and pocket depth change, and as such will be included in the final model.\nSupressor / Counfound Variables\nA model will be tested with all covariates to assess for possible suppressor / confound variables. But the other potential covariates of race, age, sites, and smoking status were not related to attachment loss or pocket depth change by themselves.\nBaseline vs 1 Year Measurements\nThe baseline measurements of attachment loss and pocket depth were significant predictors of attachment loss and pocket depth at 1 year, respectively. While the RCT nature of the study should ensure that participants were randomly assigned into treatment condition regardless of their baseline measurements, it will still be good practice to include baseline attachment loss and pocket depth into the final model.\nAttachment Loss vs Pocket Depth Change Scores\nAttachment loss and pocket depth change are highly related to each other, but this should not impact the analysis. PI’s will need to be consulted to interpret the clinical significance of findings, and to help fully understand the implications of any possible differences that may arise between attachment loss and pocket depth change in the analysis.\nBack to top of tabset"

Let’s do that.\n\n# Create a scatterplot of jackknife residuals vs ID to assess independence for pocket depth change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = id, y = jackknife_residuals_attach)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Jackknife Residuals vs ID for Attachment Loss Change\",\n       x = \"ID\",\n       y = \"Jackknife Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a scatterplot of jackknife residuals vs ID to assess independence for pocket depth change\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = id, y = jackknife_residuals_pd)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Residuals vs ID for Pocket Depth Change\",\n       x = \"ID\",\n       y = \"Jackknife Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern appears random, suggesting independence.\nNote: The gap between ID’s 170 and 200 looks odd, but is an artifact from how the experimenters assigned ID, with females starting at 101, and males starting at 201.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nHere we will asses that, for any fixed value of X, Y has a normal distribution. We will do this using Q-Q plots and histograms of the residuals.\n\n# Make the Q-Q plots using the jackknife residuals for attachment loss change\nqqnorm(jackknife_residuals_attach, main = \"Q-Q plots of Jackknife Residuals for model_attach\")\nqqline(jackknife_residuals_attach, col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create histogram of jackknife residuals for model_attach\nhist(jackknife_residuals_attach, main = \"Histogram of Jackknife Residuals\",\n     xlab = \"Jackknife Residuals\",\n     col = \"lightblue\",\n     border = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make the Q-Q plots using the jackknife residuals for pocket depth change\nqqnorm(jackknife_residuals_pd, main = \"Q-Q plots of Jackknife Residuals for model_pd\")\nqqline(jackknife_residuals_pd, col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create histogram of jackknife residuals for model_pd\nhist(jackknife_residuals_pd, main = \"Histogram of Jackknife Residuals\",\n     xlab = \"Jackknife Residuals\",\n     col = \"lightblue\",\n     border = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram for attachment loss change is a little left-tailed. This could be from an outlier. Comparatively, the Q-Q plot and histogram of the residuals for pocket depth change are normally distributed.\nWe can also include the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, which provides a p-value and allows us to numerically establish that the assumption of normality is met. If the p-value is &lt; 0.05 you conclude that the assumption of normality is not met.\n\nshapiro.test(jackknife_residuals_attach)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  jackknife_residuals_attach\nW = 0.9604, p-value = 0.003601\n\nshapiro.test(jackknife_residuals_pd)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  jackknife_residuals_pd\nW = 0.99059, p-value = 0.6933\n\n\nThe assumption of normality is violated for the attachment loss change model (p = 0.0036), but not for the pocket depth change model (p = 0.6933). Looking at the histogram of the residuals for attachment loss change, this is likely due to an outlier.\nSummary\nFor attachment loss change, we have a slight violation of normality, which could be due to the presence of an outlier. However, regressions are robust to violations of assumptions and this may not actually be an issue. Outliers in the model will be assessed using jackknife residuals to confirm that these points do not have an excessive amount of influence on the model.\nBased on the Q-Q plots and histograms of the residuals for pocket depth change, we can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nUsing the scale-location plot will allow us to evaluate the constant variance assumption. This will allow us to see whether the variability of the residuals is roughly constant between each group (Source).\nTo assess homoscedasticity we examine the residual scatterplots by treatment group. The warning sign to look for here is if the variance differs greatly across groups.\n\n# Make the residual scatterplot using the jackknife residuals for model_attach\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = trtgroup, y = jackknife_residuals_attach)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(title = \"Jackknife Residuals vs Treatment Condition for Attachment Loss Change\",\n       x = \"Treatment Condition\",\n       y = \"JackKnife Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make the residual scatterplot using the jackknife residuals for model_pd\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = trtgroup, y = jackknife_residuals_pd)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(title = \"Jackknife Residuals vs Treatment Condition for Pocket Depth Change\",\n       x = \"Treatment Condition\",\n       y = \"JackKnife Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that our variances in all groups are equal!\nAdditionally, while it is not recommended to perform a statistical test to assess for equality of variances (because formal tests of equality of variance are not very powerful), we can still do this using Bartlett’s test.\n\nbartlett.test(attachchange ~ trtgroup, data = data_missing)\n\n\n    Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances\n\ndata:  attachchange by trtgroup\nBartlett's K-squared = 2.5462, df = 4, p-value = 0.6364\n\n\nThe null hypothesis of the Bartlett test is that the variances are equal. Thus failing to reject the null (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that the data are consistent with the equal variance assumption.\nSo we meet the assumption of equality of variances, looking good!\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nTo start, we can simply check that the mean of our residuals is close to 0.\n\n#### For attachment loss change score\n# Generate the mean of the jackknife residuals for attachment loss change. Should be close to 0.\nmean(jackknife_residuals_attach)\n\n[1] -0.004132486\n\n\nWe are looking good for attachment loss change score.

Should be close to 0.\nmean(jackknife_residuals_pd)\n\n[1] -6.695748e-06\n\n\nA more sophisticated approach is to plot the fitted values vs jackknife residuals. We can then compare the trend between groups to see if they are random. The fitted line should gravitate around 0 with no obvious trends.\n\n# Generate vectors containing the fitted values vs jackknife residuals so we can plot them \nfitted_values_pd &lt;- fitted(model_pd)\n\nggplot(data_missing, aes(x = fitted_values_pd, y = jackknife_residuals_pd)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  labs(title = \"Jackknife Residuals vs Fitted Values for Attachment Loss Change\",\n       x = \"Fitted Values\",\n       y = \"Jackknife Residuals\")\n\n$x\n[1] \"Fitted Values\"\n\n$y\n[1] \"Jackknife Residuals\"\n\n$title\n[1] \"Jackknife Residuals vs Fitted Values for Attachment Loss Change\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\nThe pattern looks random and we can conclude we meet this assumption.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nWe meet the assumptions of independence, equal variances, and errors centered around zero required for this analysis. There is a slight violation of normality for the attachment loss change model, but this could be due to an outlier."

    "text": "Multiple Imputation\n\nBackgroundCoding ExamplePerforming the Multiple Imputation\n\n\nNote: This information is taken from Biostats II (BIOS 6612) slides, week 13 lecture 20, and from Flexible Imputation of Missing Data 2nd edition.\nMissing Data\nTo review, there are several assumptions for missing data. The first is MCAR (Missing Completely at Random). This is when the probability of having a missing value is the same for everyone, and is rarely ever the case with real data.\nThe second is MAR (missing at random). This is when the probability of having a missing value is the same within groups defined by the observed data. That is, if we know that second variable by which the data is NOT MCAR, in addition to the measurements, we can assume MCAR within that second variable. For instance, if we know the missing data is not equal between the sexes, then we can assume MCAR within groups defined by sex. MAR is often observed in situations such as males missing more data than females, or older participants missing more data than younger ones, etc. MAR is more general and more realistic than MCAR. Modern missing data assumptions typically start from the MAR assumption.\nMNAR (Missing Not At Random) is the final category of missingness, and is when the the probability of having a missing value varies for reasons that are unknown to you. For example, in public opinion research, those with weaker opinions may respond less than those with stronger opinions, and you may not know this ahead of time. MNAR is the most complex and if you have it, you have your work cut out for you. In that situation, you can find more data about the causes for the missingness, or run lots and lots of sensitivity analyses.\nAnd as they say, the best way to handle missing data is not to have it.\nMultiple Imputation\nIn the current experiment, we know that data is not MCAR (males are missing more data than females), and thus cannot simply throw out subjects with missing values. If the data are not MCAR, listwise deletion (deleting any subject with a missing value) can severely bias estimates of means, regression coefficients and correlations.\nMultiple Imputation is a commonly used method to handle missing data when data is not MCAR, but is MAR. It is a process by which you use observed data to “predict” missing data, then use those “imputed” values in further analyses. Multiple imputation builds upon and pools together “single” imputation approaches.\nFor example, there exists very simple ways of imputing data, such as plugging in the average or median values in place of missing values. This is not sophisticated and kind of sketchy.\nThen there exists regression imputation, where for each variable you fit a regression model of it to the observed data, and then use that model to predict missing values, and use those predictions in place of the missing values. However, this injects bias into the estimate for the correlation between X and Y (since the values fall perfectly in line with the hypothesis that X and Y have a non zero correlation. (and are in a perfect line)).\n\nThen there is stochastic regression imputation, which is like regression imputation but adds noise back into the imputations based on the variance of their residuals. This helps account for variance in the results due to missing data.\n\nMultiple imputation works by fitting multiple stochastic imputation models (can be 100’s or 1000’s), analyzing each dataset separately to produce estimates of interest, and finally pooling together these statistics of interest. If done properly, the pooled statistics are unbiased under MAR, and the SE’s will be correct!\n\nMultiple Imputation is “simple, elegant and powerful. It is simple because it fills the holes in the data with plausible values. It is elegant because the uncertainty about the unknown data is coded in the data itself. And it is powerful because it can solve “other” problems that are actually missing data problems in disguise.” - Stef van Buuren\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nFirst we will begin with an example of multiple imputation using the built in airquality dataset in R.\n\n# Examining data set and missingness\nhead(airquality)\n\n  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day\n1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1\n2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2\n3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3\n4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4\n5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5\n6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6\n\ncolSums(is.na(airquality))\n\n  Ozone Solar.R    Wind    Temp   Month     Day \n     37       7       0       0       0       0 \n\nvis_miss(airquality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re missing 37 values in the Ozone column (24% of values!). We will have to address this missing data somehow.\nMean Imputation\nWe could quickly fill in missing data with mean imputation…\n\n# Here's how you do mean imputation in mice\nimp &lt;- mice(airquality, method = \"mean\", m = 1, maxit = 1)\n\n\n iter imp variable\n  1   1  Ozone  Solar.R\n\n\nBut mean imputation will “underestimate the variance, disturb the relations between variables, bias almost any estimate other than the mean and bias the estimate of the mean when data are not MCAR.” You can use mean imputation as a quick fix when there’s a handful of missing values, but it should be avoided in general.\nRegression Imputation\nWe could alternatively do regression imputation, where we fit a model and then use that model to predict the missing values. In regression imputation, you are essentially using the observed data to predict the missing data.\n\n# Performing regression imputation using the mice package\ndata_example &lt;- airquality[, c(\"Ozone\", \"Solar.R\")]\nimp &lt;- mice(data_example, method = \"norm.predict\", seed = 1,\n           m = 1, print = FALSE)\n\n# Plotting missing vs observed values\nxyplot(imp, Ozone ~ Solar.R,\n       main = \"Missing vs Observed values for Ozone ~ Solar.R\",\n       auto.key = list(corner = c(0,1),\n                  points = TRUE, \n                  text = c(\"Observed\", \"Missing\"), col = c(\"steelblue\", \"red3\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou predict the values of the missing datapoints with the regression equation resulting from your model. That is, the imputed values correspond to the most likely values under that model. However, the imputed values (red) vary less than the observed values (blue). So each value is the best under the model, but it is very unlikely that the real values would have had this distribution.\nRegression imputation yields unbiased estimates of the means and of the regression weights of the model under MCAR. It also does so under MAR, provided that the factors that influence missinginess are part of the model. However, correlations are biased to be greater/higher.\n“Regression imputation, as well as its modern incarnations in machine learning is probably the most dangerous of all methods described here. We may be led to believe that we’re to do a good job by preserving the relations between the variables. In reality however, regression imputation artificially strengthens the relations in the data. Correlations are biased upwards. Variability is underestimated. Imputations are too good to be true. Regression imputation is a recipe for false positive and spurious relations.”\nStochastic regression imputation\nStochastic regression imputation is a refinement of regression imputation that attempts to address correlation bias by adding noise back into the predictions of the missing values.\n\n# Impute Ozone from Solar.R by stochastic regression imputation using the mice package.\ndata_example &lt;- airquality[, c(\"Ozone\", \"Solar.R\")]\n\n# Perform stochastic regression imputation\nimp &lt;- mice(data_example, method = \"norm.nob\", m = 1, maxit = 1, seed = 1, print = FALSE)\n\n# Plotting missing vs observed values\nxyplot(imp, Ozone ~ Solar.R,\n       main = \"Missing vs Observed values for Ozone ~ Solar.R\",\n       auto.key = list(corner = c(0,1),\n                  points = TRUE, \n                  text = c(\"Observed\", \"Missing\"), col = c(\"steelblue\", \"red3\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The method = norm.nob argument requests a plain, non-Bayesian, stochastic regression method. This method first estimates the intercept, slope and residual variance under the linear model, then calculates the predicted value for each missing value, and adds a random draw from the residual to the prediction”.\nThis can create issues though, such as we have one imputed value that is negative! Which might not be plausible (such as in this case, there is no such thing as a negative ozone level).\nA more convenient solution is multiple imputation\nMultiple Imputation\nMultiple imputation creates m &gt; 1 complete data sets. The m results are then pooled into a final point estimate plus standard error. So each data set is identical in observed values, but differs in imputed values.\nWe then estimate the parameters of interest from each dataset. This is done by applying the analytic method you would have used if the dataset was complete in the first place (here, a regression). The results of the model on each dataset will differ because the data is different. These differences are caused by the uncertainty of what value to impute.\nThe last step is that these parameter estimates are then pooled together into a single value, and its variance estimated. The variance is assessed by combining the “within-imputation variance with the extra variance caused by the missing data (between-imputation variance)”. So under the appropriate conditions the pooled estimates are unbiased. MI solves the problem of ‘too small’ SEs of other imputation methods we just covered.\nNow let’s perform the multiple imputation on the airquality data set.\n\n# Perform multiple imputation on the airquality data set\nimp &lt;- mice(airquality, seed = 1, m = 20, print = FALSE) # This line imputes the missing data 20 times\n\n# Fit a linear regression \nmodel_imp &lt;- with(imp, lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R)) # You have to run the regression with \"with(imp, lm(etc))\n                  \nsummary(model_imp) # This runs a regression on each imputed dataset (so 20 different regressions)\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 6\n   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value  nobs\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 (Intercept) -60.7      17.9        -3.40 8.78e- 4   153\n 2 Wind         -2.95      0.514      -5.75 4.96e- 8   153\n 3 Temp          1.53      0.197       7.74 1.42e-12   153\n 4 Solar.R       0.0671    0.0184      3.64 3.70e- 4   153\n 5 (Intercept) -56.8      18.5        -3.07 2.56e- 3   153\n 6 Wind         -3.33      0.532      -6.25 4.04e- 9   153\n 7 Temp          1.56      0.205       7.58 3.49e-12   153\n 8 Solar.R       0.0554    0.0191      2.89 4.37e- 3   153\n 9 (Intercept) -74.0      18.7        -3.95 1.19e- 4   153\n10 Wind         -2.69      0.540      -4.99 1.67e- 6   153\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\nsummary(pool(model_imp)) # This pools together the parameters of all 20 regressions (statistic is Wald's test) into a single model.\n\n         term     estimate   std.error statistic       df      p.value\n1 (Intercept) -65.87829658 23.09377412 -2.852643 69.97033 5.696702e-03\n2        Wind  -3.01897171  0.66252377 -4.556775 70.51194 2.125022e-05\n3        Temp   1.63483547  0.25107557  6.511328 75.99913 7.203792e-09\n4     Solar.R   0.05861581  0.02267832  2.584662 90.10797 1.135441e-02\n\n\n\n# mids workflow using pipes\nest3 &lt;- airquality %&gt;%\n  mice(seed = 1, print = FALSE, m = 20) %&gt;%\n  with(lm(formula = Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R)) %&gt;%\n  pool()\nsummary(est3)\n\n         term     estimate   std.error statistic       df      p.value\n1 (Intercept) -65.87829658 23.09377412 -2.852643 69.97033 5.696702e-03\n2        Wind  -3.01897171  0.66252377 -4.556775 70.51194 2.125022e-05\n3        Temp   1.63483547  0.25107557  6.511328 75.99913 7.203792e-09\n4     Solar.R   0.05861581  0.02267832  2.584662 90.10797 1.135441e-02\n\n\n\n# Run a regression on the imputed airquality data set. \nimp &lt;- mice(airquality, seed = 1, print = FALSE)\n\nfit &lt;- with(imp, lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R))\n\n# Print out the estimates for the first and second data set\ncoef(fit$analyses[[1]])\n\n(Intercept)     Solar.R \n 22.2963201   0.1057437 \n\ncoef(fit$analyses[[2]])\n\n(Intercept)     Solar.R \n 20.7891622   0.1140081 \n\n\nNotice that the paremter estimates differ because of the uncertainty created by the missing data.\nApplying the standard pooling rules is done with\n\nest &lt;- pool(fit)\nsummary(est)\n\n         term   estimate  std.error statistic       df      p.value\n1 (Intercept) 21.5321395 5.67991951  3.790923 136.3544 0.0002245626\n2     Solar.R  0.1091546 0.02846503  3.834693 102.7169 0.0002170873\n\n\nAny R expression produced by expression() can be used on the multiply imputed data…\n\n# Extract residuals and fitted values\n\n# This gets you ALL the residuals for ALL the models/dataset\nimp_residuals &lt;- sapply(model_imp[[4]], residuals)\n\n# Same thing but for the fitted\nimp_fitted &lt;- sapply(model_imp[[4]],fitted)\n\n# Don't know where to go from here.

This method yields incorrect standard errors, confidence intervals and p-values, and thus should not be used if any form of statistical testing or uncertainty analysis is to be done on the imputed data. The reason is that the procedure ignores the between-imputation variability, and hence shares all the drawbacks of single imputation”.\nNote: It’s recommended to impute then transform, because if you create variables based on other variables, there are relationships between those variables that MI doesn’t account for (it might create combinations of variables that are unrealistic)\nYou can do this as\n\n# Example of impute then transform method (i.e. how to add variables to an imputed dataset)\ndata_ex &lt;- boys[, c(\"age\", \"hgt\", \"wgt\", \"hc\", \"reg\")]\nimp &lt;- mice(data_ex, print = FALSE, seed = 1)\n \n# put the data in long format\nlong &lt;- mice::complete(imp, \"long\", include = TRUE)\n\nlong$new_var &lt;- with(long, 100 * wgt / hgt)\n\nimp.itt &lt;- as.mids(long)\n\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nNow that we have reviewed the background and gone through coding examples of multiple imputation, we are ready to perform it for the dataset for Project 1.\n\n# Pool the parameters of interest for a regression on the imputed values for attach change control as reference\nmodel_imp &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mice(seed = 1, print = FALSE, m = 20) %&gt;%\n  with(lm(attachchange ~ placebo + low + medium + high)) %&gt;%\n  pool()\n\nWarning: Number of logged events: 1158\n\n\nNone of the p-values for the pooled regressions on the MI data are significant (p &gt; 0.05).\nHow do those parameter estimates compare to the complete case analysis model?\n\n# Compare coefficients to complete case analysis for attachment loss with control as reference category\nMI &lt;- summary(model_imp)\nMI\n\n         term   estimate  std.error  statistic       df     p.value\n1 (Intercept) -0.1853493 0.06920536 -2.6782512 65.79196 0.009337056\n2     placebo  0.1158204 0.09076258  1.2760813 91.37003 0.205161055\n3         low  0.1608502 0.10027097  1.6041549 59.48514 0.113976747\n4      medium  0.1612700 0.11393844  1.4154130 37.61151 0.165174849\n5        high  0.0930271 0.15435067  0.6026997 18.41109 0.554060413\n\ncomplete_case &lt;- summary(model_attach1)\ncomplete_case$coefficients\n\n               Estimate Std.

    "text": "Identify Outliers using Jackknife Residuals\nIn this section we will explore how our analysis would have changed if we identified outliers using the jackknife residuals.\n\nBackgroundIdentifying OutliersRerunning the Model with Outliers Removed\n\n\n*Note: This information is from BIOS 6602 Week 6 Lecture 10\nJackknife residuals are a type of residual used in regressions that allows us to detect outliers that have a significant impact on the regression coefficients of the model.\nJackknife residuals are calculated by systematically leaving out one observation (i) at a time from a dataset, fitting the regression model to the remaining dataset, and predicting the left out observation. The residual for each observation is then computed based on that prediction.\nThis process follows three step:\n\nFit the regression model to the data, excluding observation (i)\nUse the model to predict the left-out observation (i)\nCalculate the jackknife residual as the difference between the actual value and that fitted value\n\nJackknife residuals are similar to standardized residuals. Standardized residuals are standardized by the standard error of the regression, and are primarily used for identifying outliers. Jackknife residuals on the other hand allow you to assess the leverage of individuals data points, to see how much they actually influence the model (Source)\n\nJackknife residuals follow exactly a t(n-p-2) distribution, where approximately 5% of residuals are expected to exceed 1.96 in absolute value. Jackknife residuals make suspicious values more obvious compared to other residuals.\nDefinitions vary, but we generally consider a residual to be an outlier if the jackknife residual is +- 3.\nHowever, a potential outlier value may not actually have that dramatic of an impact on the model (which is what we are concerned that outliers will do). That is why we use jackknife residuals to investigate leverage and influence.\n\nExtreme X values can have high leverage.\nExtreme X values can have high influence\nA high-leverage point becomes an influential point if its Y value doesn’t follow the pattern of the rest of the data (i.e. is too low or too high)\n\n\nAn observation is influential if removing it substantially changes the estimate of the coefficients for that model. We use five measurements to assess influence: Jackknife residuals, Leverage, Cook’s Distance (Cook’s D), DFFITS, and DFBETAS.\n\nLeverage: Measures how far a measurement deviates from the mean. You want to examine values greater than 2(p+1)/n\nCook’s D: Measures the influence of an observation on regression predictions. You want to examine observations with d_i &gt; 1.0\nDFFITS: Measures the influence of an observation on regression predictions (related to Cook’s D). You want to examine observations outside the range of +-2(sqrt(p+10n)). If h_i is near zero, then that observation has little effect.\nDDFBETAS: Measure the influence of an observation on *individual* coefficient estimates. You want to examine estimates outside the range of +- 2/sqrt(n). A large DFBETA for variable k indicates that the i-th observation has a sizeable impact on the k-th regression coefficient.\n\nNote: p = the number of variables in the model\n\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nThis website was used for coding information for this section, alongside the notes from BIOS 6602\nNow that we have covered the background for jackknife residuals, we can apply that knowledge to assess for outliers in our dataset for this project!\n\nAttachment LossPocket Depth\n\n\n\nSet upJackknife ResidualsLeverageCook’s DDFFITSDFBETASAdditional PlotsFinal Look and Conclusion\n\n\nRecall that we computed the jackknife residuals earlier.\n\n# Calculate the jackknife residuals of model_attach\njackknife_residuals_attach &lt;- rstudent(model_attach1)\n\n# Calculate the jackknife residuals of model_pd\njackknife_residuals_pd &lt;- rstudent(model_pd)\n\nLet’s generate a table so we can handily compare: ID, jackknife residual, leverage (diagonal hat), DFFITS, and DFBETAs for each participant.\n\n# Get leverage values (hat values)\nhat_values_attach &lt;- hatvalues(model_attach1)\n\n# Get Cook's D values\ncooks_d_attach &lt;- cooks.distance(model_attach1)\n\n# Get the DFFITS values\ndffits_attach &lt;- dffits(model_attach1)\n\n# Get the DFBETAS\ndfbetas_attach &lt;- dfbetas(model_attach1)\n\n# Make a table with ID and all diagnostic values\ndiagnostics_attach &lt;- data.frame(id = data_missing$id, jackknife_residuals = jackknife_residuals_attach, leverage = hat_values_attach, cooks_D = cooks_d_attach, dffits = dffits_attach, dfbetas = dfbetas_attach)\n\nkable(head(diagnostics_attach), caption = \"Diagnostics for Attachment Loss Change Model\", format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\nDiagnostics for Attachment Loss Change Model\n\n\nid\njackknife_residuals\nleverage\ncooks_D\ndffits\ndfbetas..Intercept.\ndfbetas.placebo\ndfbetas.low\ndfbetas.medium\ndfbetas.high\n\n\n\n\n101\n0.5800959\n0.0500000\n0.0035664\n0.1330831\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0973313\n0.0000000\n\n\n103\n1.5996714\n0.0434783\n0.0228989\n0.3410511\n0.3410511\n-0.2411595\n-0.2356149\n-0.2325949\n-0.2184475\n\n\n104\n1.4044559\n0.0476190\n0.0195311\n0.3140459\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.2270548\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n\n\n105\n-0.8928811\n0.0434783\n0.0072626\n-0.1903629\n0.0000000\n-0.1346069\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n\n\n106\n-1.6995151\n0.0500000\n0.0298289\n-0.3898955\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n-0.2851530\n0.0000000\n\n\n107\n-2.7107885\n0.0476190\n0.0690131\n-0.6061507\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n-0.4382463\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nWe can start by making a plot of the jackknife residuals to assess if there are outliers &lt;

In other words, leverage is a measurement of how far that observation deviates from the mean of that variable. High leverage observations have the potential to be very influential, but they are not necessarily influential. It’s possible for a high leverage point to not be influential, but very difficult for a low leverage point to be influential.\nLeverage is calculated as\n&lt;img src=“Media/leverage.png” width=“90%&gt;\nIf X _i is close to Xbar, then h_i is small (i.e. the i-th point has low leverage).\n\n# Caculate cutoff for leverage\ncutoff_leverage &lt;- 2*((4+1)/103)\ncutoff_leverage\n\n[1] 0.09708738\n\n# Make leverage plot in ggplot.

I think this may be because the IV is categorical which changes the pattern and interpretation. Will check with a professor.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nCook’s D combines information about the residuals and leverage into a single value. A higher Cook’s D value signifies that the data point woud greatly change the regression coefficients, and is therefore influential and may impact the model’s accuracy.\nApparently we actually want to look at a cutoff of Cook’s D as 4/(n-p-1). Let’s calculate that and store it.\n\n# Calculate cutoff for Cook's D\ncutoff_d &lt;- 4/((nrow(data_missing) - length(model_attach1$coefficients) - 1))\ncutoff_d\n\n[1] 0.04123711\n\n# Make Cook's D plot in ggplot. Set a horizontal line at the cutoff point, and label ID's for participants that pass that line\nggplot(diagnostics_attach, aes(x = id, y = cooks_D)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = cutoff_d) +\n  labs(title = \"Cook's D with Cutoff Line\",\n       x = \"ID\",\n       y = \"Cook's D\") + \n  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(cooks_D &gt; cutoff_d, id, \"\")), vjust = -0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that participants 107, 144, 146 and 168 are past the cutoff for Cook’s D. As when looking at the residuals plot, participant 168 is drastically different compared to the other potential outliers.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nNow we will examine DFFITS (Difference in fits). DFFITS is a measure used to identify influential data points in a regression analysis. It quantifes how much the predicted values (Y) of a model change when that particular observation is left out from the analysis. So in this case it is the difference in attachment loss change if we take out observation i from the analysis.\nLet’s make a plot where we label the values that are past the cutoff.\n\n# Calculate the cutoff for DFFITS\ncutoff_dffits &lt;- 2 * sqrt((4+1)/103)\ncutoff_dffits\n\n[1] 0.4406526\n\n# Make DFFITS plot in ggplot. Set a horizontal line at the cutoff points, and label ID's for participants that pass those lines.\nggplot(diagnostics_attach, aes(x = id, y = dffits)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(cutoff_dffits, -cutoff_dffits)) + \n  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(dffits &lt; -cutoff_dffits | dffits &gt; cutoff_dffits, id, \"\")), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"DFFITS by ID\",\n       x = \"ID\",\n       y = \"DFFITS\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain we are flagging participants 107, 113, 144, 168. The new addition is 113, who is right on the cutoff line. Again participant 168 is the most egregious, and the other potential outliers are a lot closer to the cutoff.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nNow we can look at the DFBETAs (Difference in Betas). DFBETAS quantify how much the beta coefficients for each variable in the model change when you exclude observation i from the analysis.\n\n# Calculate the cutoff for DFBETAS\ncutoff_dfbetas &lt;- 2/sqrt(103)\ncutoff_dfbetas\n\n[1] 0.1970659\n\n# Make DFBETAS plot in ggplot.

I think for these plots it might matter less if we’re pass that point. I think the idea here is we get a fine tune look at, for instance, how participant 168 drastically changes the beta for high, compared to how much any other point changes the betas. Other possible values of concern are 144 and 146. All the other data points are still roughly around the cutoff of .20, but 168 is around .7!\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nThe car package in R has some handy plots that we can use to help us with diagnosing outliers.\nThe first is the influence plot, which essentially combines the jackknife residuals plot with the Cook’s D plot.\n\n# Influence plot\ninfluencePlot(model_attach1, main = \"Influence Plot\",\n              sub = \"Circle size is proportional to Cook's Distance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      StudRes        Hat       CookD\n6  -2.7107885 0.04761905 0.069013121\n8  -0.5238664 0.06250000 0.003686439\n12  1.4073671 0.06250000 0.026147438\n58 -3.6028957 0.06250000 0.154223694\n\n\nUsing this plot, we can see that obseration 58 (ID 168) has the largest residual value and Cook’s D value by a large margin!\nAdditionally, a single line of code provides us with some useful diagnostic plots.\n\n# infIndexPlot gives us a series of plots that we need to investigate influence points\ninfIndexPlot(model_attach1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first plot is the Cook’s D plot, the second plot is the studentized residuals plot, and the leverage/hat values plot, all of which we plotted before. New is the third plot which is the Bonferroni P-value plot.\nBased on these plots we can see pretty readily that participant 168 is a true outlier. That is, they are a point that has high leverage AND influence in this model.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nWe saw that participant 168 is the most egregious offender, and participants 107, 144, 146, and MAYBE 113 are flagging past our different cutoff points.\nLet’s take one last look at the table of these participants\n\n# Pretty print diagnostics table of potential outliers\nkable(diagnostics_attach[diagnostics_attach$id %in% c(107,113,144,146,168),], caption = \"Correlation Matrix\", format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\n\n\n\nid\njackknife_residuals\nleverage\ncooks_D\ndffits\ndfbetas..Intercept.\ndfbetas.placebo\ndfbetas.low\ndfbetas.medium\ndfbetas.high\n\n\n\n\n6\n107\n-2.710789\n0.0476190\n0.0690131\n-0.6061507\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n-0.4382463\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n\n\n11\n113\n2.092587\n0.0434783\n0.0384816\n0.4461411\n0.0000000\n0.3154694\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n\n\n40\n144\n-2.670168\n0.0434783\n0.0610008\n-0.5692818\n-0.5692818\n0.4025431\n0.3932880\n0.3882470\n0.3646322\n\n\n42\n146\n-2.291912\n0.0434783\n0.0457672\n-0.4886373\n-0.4886373\n0.3455188\n0.3375748\n0.3332479\n0.3129784\n\n\n58\n168\n-3.602896\n0.0625000\n0.1542237\n-0.9302637\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n-0.7143938\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the board we can see that participant 168 has worse values for almost everything, in particular the jackknife residual, Cook’s D, and DFFITS values.

None as far off as 168 in the attachment loss model, 239 is the only one that is concerning.\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nThe car package in R has some handy plots that we can use to help us with diagnosing outliers.\nThe first is the influence plot, which essentially combines the jackknife residuals plot with the Cook’s D plot.\n\n# Influence plot\ninfluencePlot(model_pd, main = \"Influence Plot\",\n              sub = \"Circle size is proportional to Cook's Distance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      StudRes        Hat       CookD\n5  -2.5107398 0.05000000 0.062949101\n8  -0.8158788 0.06250000 0.008905825\n12  0.4184503 0.06250000 0.002354494\n82  2.6641548 0.04761905 0.066819586\n\n\nHere we can see that none of our residuals are +- 3, but we do have some concerns with large Cook’s distance, particularly with observation 82 (ID = 239).\nAdditionally, a single line of code provides us with some useful diagnostic plots.\n\n# infIndexPlot gives us a series of plots that we need to investigate influence points\ninfIndexPlot(model_pd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these plots, it is arguable that participant 239 is an outlier for pocket depth. Though they do not have an extreme jackknife residual, the large Cook’s distance suggests that this data point has substantial infuence on the model’s parameters.\nHowever, a closer look reveals that the influence and leverage values for the pocket depth model are all comparable to the potential outliers in the attachmnet loss model we chose to keep (Cook’s D ~0.06). Specifically, while it appears that participant 239 here has a large Cook’s D (0.068) compared to the rest of the values, it is nowhere near as high as participant 168 was in the attachment loss model (0.15)!\nBack to top of tabset\n\n\nParticipants 106 and 239 were the only potential concerns here. However, as noted, their Cook’s D is comparable to the values we kept in the attachment loss model, and are &lt; 1/2 of what the Cook’s D was for participant 168 who we plan to remove as an outlier in the attachment loss model!\n\n# Pretty print diagnostics table of potential outliers\nkable(diagnostics_pd[diagnostics_attach$id %in% c(106,239),], caption = \"Correlation Matrix\", format = \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\n\n\n\nid\njackknife_residuals\nleverage\ncooks_D\ndffits\ndfbetas..Intercept.\ndfbetas.placebo\ndfbetas.low\ndfbetas.medium\ndfbetas.high\n\n\n\n\n5\n106\n-2.510740\n0.050000\n0.0629491\n-0.5760032\n0\n0\n0.0000000\n-0.4212642\n0\n\n\n82\n239\n2.664155\n0.047619\n0.0668196\n0.5957231\n0\n0\n0.4307071\n0.0000000\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Remove participant 168 from the dataset\ndata_missing_outlier &lt;- data_missing[data_missing$id != 168,]\n\n# Run model 1 attachment loss\nmodel_attach1_outlier &lt;- lm(attachchange ~ placebo + low + medium + high, data = data_missing_outlier)\nsummary(model_attach1_outlier)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = attachchange ~ placebo + low + medium + high, data = data_missing_outlier)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.68731 -0.16279  0.04936  0.16823  0.53945 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "The aim of the current study is to assess how treatment response differs for HIV+ patients 2 years after initiating Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) based on hard drug usage (such as heroin or cocaine). This study is of particular scientific interest because it is unclear whether the use of hard drugs inhibits the immune system in humans; treatment strategies may differ based on these results. The researchers are interested in comparing subjects who never used hard drugs to current hard drug users (those that use hard drugs at year 2) or previous hard drug users (those who used drugs at year 0 or 1). Outcomes of interest are: viral load (HIV copies in a mL of blood), CD4+ T cell count (a measure of immunologic health), and aggregate physical and quality of life scores from the SF-36.\nThe clinical hypothesis is that, if hard drugs inhibit the immune system in humans, subjects who currently or previously used hard drugs will have higher viral load and lower CD4+ T cell counts than those who never used hard drugs. Additionally, the researchers are interested in knowing if potential differences between the drug use groups can be explained by differences in adherence to the treatment regimen. The researchers are agnostic on how quality of life changes after treatment, since side effects of the treatment are significant.\nThe project description provided by the PI is available below:"

Additionally, for those with low adherence to the treatment regimen, previous hard drug users had a change in log viral load that was 5.81 log copies/mL (or change in copies/mL that was 333.05 times) greater than never hard drug users (t = 4.90, p-adjusted &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: 3.48 to 8.14 log copies/mL, or 32.42 to 3421.49 times copies/mL).\nFor those with low adherence to the treatment regiment, the difference between previous and current drug users was not statistically significant (t = -1.35, p-adjusted = 0.177, 95% CI: -5.72 to 1.05 log copies/mL, or 0.0033 to 2.87 times copies/mL).\n\n\nHard Drug use at High Adherence\nFor those with high adherence to the protocol, there was no difference in log viral load between current and never hard drug users (t = 1.920, p-adjusted = 0.388, 95% CI: -0.017 to 1.48 log copies/mL), previous and never hard drug users (t = -0.086, p-adjusted = 1.00, 95% CI: -0.86 to 0.94 log copies/mL), or previous and current hard drug users (t = 1.355, p-adjusted = 1.00, 95% CI: -0.35 to 1.89 log copies/mL).\n\n\n\nAdherence\nThe relationship between adherence to the treatment regiment and change in log viral load over 2 years differed by hard drug use.\n\nAdherence for Current Hard Drug Users\nFor current hard drug users, those with high adherence had a change in log viral load that was 3.53 log copies/mL (or 0.029 times) less than that of those with low adherence (t = -2.554, p-adjusted = 0.0999936, 95% CI: -6.25 to -0.70 log copies/mL, or 0.0019 to 0.50 times). However, this relationship was not statistically significant following Bonferroni correction, likely due to the small number of patients who were hard drug users with low protocol adherence (n = 4). This relationship however does appear to be real based on trends in the data, and we recommend increasing the sample size to discover the true differences.\n\n\nAdherence for Previous Hard Drug Users\nFor previous hard drug users, those with high adherence had a change in log viral load that was 6.64 log copies/mL less (or 0.0013 times) than those with low adherence (t = -5.63, p-adjusted &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: -8.95 to -4.32 log copies/mL, or 0.00013 to 0.013 times).\n\n\nAdherence for Never Hard Drug Users\nFor never hard drug users, the difference in log viral load between those with high adherence and low adherence was not statistically significant (t = -1.61, p-adusted = 0.759, 95% CI: -1.75 to 0.17 log copies/mL, or 0.17 to 1.19 times).\n\n\n\nAdditional Interaction Comparisons\nThere are additional comparisons we can make in the interaction between hard drug usage and adherence, but they are of little clinical relevance (e.g. current hard drug users with low adherence had a higher viral load compared to never hard drug users with high adherence). Basically, any comparison made between a current or previous hard drug user with low adherence was significant.\n\n\nCollege Education at Baseline\nEducation at baseline is a significant predictor for change in log viral load over 2 years, while controlling for hard drug use and adherence to treatment regiment (t = -2.872, p = 0.00424). On average, those with a college education had an 0.85 log copies/mL (or 2.34 times) greater decrease in log viral load than those without a college education (95% CI:-1.43 to -0.27 log copies/mL).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nThe interaction between hard drug use and adherence group on log viral load can be visualized in the graph below.\n\n# Relevel reference group\ndata_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp &lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Never User\")\n\n# Relevel reference group\ndata_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW &lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW, ref = \"Low Adherence\")\n\n# Perform a regression of the full model predicting log viral load change\nmodel_VLOAD_full &lt;- lm(VLOAD_log_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + hard_drugs_grp * ADH_HIGHVSLOW + EDUC_COLLEGE, data = data_wide_2)\n\nlibrary(interactions)\n\n# Use interactions package to plot interaction\ncat_plot(\n  model_VLOAD_full, \n  pred = hard_drugs_grp, \n  modx = ADH_HIGHVSLOW, \n  geom = \"line\", \n  colors = \"Pastel2\",\n  x.label = \"Hard Drugs Group\",\n  y.label = \"Predicted Log Viral Load Change\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis very clearly illustrates the relationships we saw in our model.\nWe can see the relationship between adherence and change in log viral load based on hard drug use: for previous and current hard drug users, those with high adherence had a reduced viral load compared to those with low adherence.\nSimilarly, we can see the relationship between hard drug use and change in log viral load based on adherence: For those with low adherence, previous and current drug users had a higher viral load compared to those with high adherence.\nInterestingly, viral load did not seem to differ for never users based on adherence, suggesting that the ART treatment is most important for those with current or previous hard drug use history.\nImportantly however, this plot is not replicated exactly when I recreate it in ggplot2.\n\n# Filter out NA values\ndata_no_na &lt;- data_wide_2 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(ADH_HIGHVSLOW))\n\n# Summarize the data (using mean as an example)\ndata_summary &lt;- data_no_na %&gt;%\n  group_by(hard_drugs_grp, ADH_HIGHVSLOW) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_VLOAD_log_CHANGE = mean(VLOAD_log_CHANGE, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'hard_drugs_grp'.

On average, those with a college education had a change in log viral load that was 0.69 log copies/mL (or 1.99 times) less than those without a college education (95% CI: -2.70 to -0.98 log copies/mL, or 0.067 to 0.37 times).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nThe reduced model without the interaction has an adjusted R-squared of 0.0529, compared to the full model with the interaction term (R^2-adjusted = 0.090).\nTherefore, dropping the interaction term causes us to lose explanation of 3.71% of the variance in log viral load change, but is also more statistically sound since we no longer have small sample size issues.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the classical definition of a confounder, a variable Z is a confounder if:\n\n\nIt is associated with outcome Y\n\n\nIt is associated with PEV X\n\n\nIt is not on the causal pathway (not a mediator)\n\n\nWe know that ADH_HIGHVSLOW is a predictor of VLOAD_log_CHANGE.\nTo assess if ADH_HIGHVSLOW is associated with hard drug use group, we can run a Fisher’s test\n\n# Create a contingency table\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, data_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW)\n\n# We have to run Fisher's Exact test since we have fewer than 5 observations in some categories\nfisher_test &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\n\nfisher_test\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.4168\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\n\n# Create a contingency table\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, data_wide_2$EDUC_COLLEGE)\n\n# We have to run Fisher's Exact test since we have fewer than 5 observations in some categories\nfisher_test &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\n\nThey are not associated.\nHowever, it is not necessary for this associaton to be statistically significant for there to be important confounding present.\nWhen we ran drug_use_grp by itself as a predictor on log viral load, the overall model was significant, but after correcting for multiple pairwise comparisons, none of the between-group comparisons was significant (p &gt; 0.05).\nHowever, after including ADH_HIGHVSLOW in the model, the current vs never drug use comparison is significant, even after performing a Bonferroni correction (p-adjusted = 0.0447). In the model without ADH, this same comparison was p-adjusted = 0.1377.\nThus, ADH_HIGHVSLOW is associated with the outcome variable, and changes the relationship between the PEV and outcome variable in a meaningful way when included in the model (changes it from not significant to significant), meeting the definition of a confounder under the classical definition. However, the beta coefficient of the PEV does not change by &gt; 20%, not satisfying the operational definition of a confounder.\nAdherence to the treatment regiment is therefore a maverick variable!\nTop of Tabset\n\n\nHere we will create some simple plots to help with visualizing the main effects of hard drug use and adherence on log viral load change.\n\n# Create boxplots of log viral load change by hard drug use group\nggplot(data_wide_2, aes(x = hard_drugs_grp, y = VLOAD_log_CHANGE, fill = hard_drugs_grp)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Pastel2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Log Viral Load Change by Hard Drug Use Group\",\n       x = \"Hard Drug Use Group\",\n       y = \"Log Viral Load Change\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Hard Drug Use Group\"))\n\nWarning: Removed 18 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that current and previous drug users had less of a decrease in log viral load over 2 years compared to never hard drug users.\n\n# Create boxplots of log viral load change by adherence group\nggplot(data_no_na, aes(x = ADH_HIGHVSLOW, y = VLOAD_log_CHANGE, fill = ADH_HIGHVSLOW)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Pastel2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Log Viral Load Change by Adherence at Year 2\",\n       x = \"Adherence at year 2\",\n       y = \"Log Viral Load Change\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Adherence Group\"))\n\nWarning: Removed 18 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here we can see those with high adherence had a higher decrease in log viral load over 2 years compared to those with low adherence.\n\n\n\n:::"

Current hard drug users did not differ from previous hard drug users on change in CD4+ T Cell count over 2 years (t = -0.32, p-adjusted= 1.00, 95% CI: -85.79 to 61.93).\n\n\n\n\nAdherence\nThe relationship between adherence to the treatment regiment and change in CD4+ T Cell count over 2 years differed by hard drug use.\n\nAdherence for Current Hard Drug Users\nFor current hard drug users, those with high adherence did not differ significantly in average change in CD4+ T Cells over two years compared to those with low adherence (t = 1.24, p-adjusted = 0.22, 95% CI: -68.51 to 300.57).\n\n\n\nAdherence for Previous Hard Drug Users\nFor previous hard drug users, those with high adherence had on average a 214.03 cells greater decrease in CD4+ T Cell count compared to those with low adherence (t = -2.70, p = 0.0073, 95% CI: -370.05 to -58.020).\n\n\nAdherence for Never Hard Drug Users\nFor never drug users, those with high adherence had on average a 83.09 cells greater decrease in CD4+ T Cell count compared to those with low adherence (t = 2.52, p = 0.0119, 95% CI: 18.42283 147.76529).\n\n\nAdditional Interaction Comparisons\nThere are additional comparisons we can make in the interaction between hard drug usage and adherence, but they are of little clinical relevance (e.g. comparing current hard drug users with low adherence to never hard drug users with high adherence). ### Frailty Related Phenotype\nFrailty Related Phenotype was a significant predictor for change in CD4+ T Cell count over 2 years, while controlling for hard drug use and adherence to the treatment regiment (t = -3.21, p = 0.0014). On average, those with a Frailty Related Phenotype had a 113.63 cells greater decrease in CD4+ T Cell count than those without a Frailty Related Phenotype (95% CI: 44.12 to 183.13 cells).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nThe below plot is useful in interpreting the interaction\n\n# Use interactions package to plot interaction\ncat_plot(\n  model_LEU3N_final1, \n  pred = hard_drugs_grp, \n  modx = ADH_HIGHVSLOW, \n  geom = \"line\", \n  colors = \"Pastel2\",\n  x.label = \"Hard Drugs Group\",\n  y.label = \"Predicted CD4+ T Cell Count Change\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter out NA values\ndata_no_na &lt;- data_wide_2 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(ADH_HIGHVSLOW))\n\n# Create the plot with lines\nggplot(data_no_na, aes(x = hard_drugs_grp, y = LEU3N_CHANGE, fill = ADH_HIGHVSLOW)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Interaction between Hard Drugs and Adherence on LEU3N Change\",\n       x = \"Hard Drugs Group\",\n       y = \"LEU3N Change\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Adherence Group\")) +\n   theme_minimal() \n\nWarning: Removed 18 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see the key relationships in our model.\nFor current hard drug users, those with high adherence did not differ from those with low adherence. This may be an artifact of the small number of current hard drug users with low adherence, however (n = 6).\nFor previous hard drug users, those with high adherence had a smaller increase in CD4+ T Cell count compared to those with low adherence. This is a counter-inuitive finding and may be an artifact of the small number of previous hard drug users with low adherence, however (n=4). It may be of interest to the clinicians however, and we therefore report it here.\nFor never hard drug users, those with high adherence had a greater increase in CD4+ T Cell count compared to those with low adherence.\nAt low adherence, previous hard drug users had greater increase in CD4+ T Cell count compared to never hard drug users, and also when compared to current hard drug users. Current hard drugs users did not differ crom never hard drug users in change in CD4+ T Cell count at low adherence.\nAt high adherence, never drug users had a greater increase in CD4+ T cell count compared to previous and current hard drug users. Current hard drug users did not differ from previous hard drug users at high adherence.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysisInterpretationVisualizing Main Effects\n\n\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp&lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Never User\")\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW &lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW, ref = \"Low Adherence\")\n\n# Perform regression on CD4+ T Cell count change by hard drugs group with covariates as determined by backward elimination\nmodel_LEU3N_final_noX1 &lt;- lm(LEU3N_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + FRP_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\n# Examine the summary\nsummary(model_LEU3N_final_noX1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = LEU3N_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + \n    FRP_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-697.88 -115.61   -3.14  114.98 1080.85 \n\nCoefficients:\n                            Estimate Std.

For previous drug users, those with low adherence have a mental QOL change that is on average 13.39 points lower than those with high adherence (p= 0.0118). Depending on how we handle multiple pairwise comparisons, this may not be significant!\nSomething fishy is going on here…\nLet’s examine this in a simplified model with no interactions.\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp&lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Previous User\")\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW &lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW, ref = \"Low Adherence\")\n\n# Perform regression on mental QOL change by hard drugs group, full model\nmodel_MENT_simple &lt;- lm(AGG_MENT_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW +  CESD_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\n# Examine the summary\nsummary(model_MENT_simple)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = AGG_MENT_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + \n    CESD_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-32.274  -6.421  -1.574   5.343  39.297 \n\nCoefficients:\n                            Estimate Std.

Specifically:\nHard drug use is a significant predictor of depression score (F~(2, 542)~= 14.31). On average, current hard drug users had depression scores that were 5.23 points higher than never hard drug users (p &lt; 0.0001), and previous hard drug users had depression scores that were 7.29 points higher than those who never used hard drugs (p &lt; 0.0001).\nThus, depression meets criteria 1 of the classical definition for a confounder: It is related to the PEV.\n\n\nConfounder is related to the Outcome Measure\nWe also saw in the interactive variable selection that depression was significantly related change in mental QOL change.\nThus depression meets criteria 2 of the classical definition for a confounder: it is related to the main outcome.\n\n\nConfounder is not a Mediator\nIt is possible that depression is on the causal pathway for mental QOL (hard drug use -&gt; depression -&gt; mental QOL), but it is likewise possible that mental QOL is on the causal pathway for depression (hard drug use -&gt; mental QOL -&gt; depression). Thus we cannot conclude that depression is a mediator.\n\n\nConfounder Meaningfully Changes the Relationship of PEV on Outcome\nWe also saw that including depression in the model changed hard drug use from being significant to not significant. Thus depression score changes the relationship between the PEV and outcome measure in a very meaningful way.\nI therefore feel justified in exploring depression as a confounder, and analyzing whether an interaction term between hard drug use group and depression will add explanatory power to our model.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nLet’s run a new full model, with the included interaction term between hard drug use group and depression. In essence we are running a three way interaction. It will need to be emphasized in the discussion that this was exploratory data analysis.\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group\ndata_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp&lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Current User\")\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group\ndata_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW &lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW, ref = \"Low Adherence\")\n\n# Perform regression on mental QOL change by hard drugs group, full model\nmodel_MENT_newfull &lt;- lm(AGG_MENT_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW +  CESD_2 + hard_drugs_grp*ADH_HIGHVSLOW + hard_drugs_grp*CESD_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\n# Examine the summary\nsummary(model_MENT_newfull)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = AGG_MENT_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + \n    CESD_2 + hard_drugs_grp * ADH_HIGHVSLOW + hard_drugs_grp * \n    CESD_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-33.459  -6.016  -1.375   5.512  37.513 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                                        Estimate Std.

However we don’t necessarily have the sample size to run a three-way interaction.\n\n\nNext Steps\nThus, we will proceed in two ways from here, and run separate models for:\n\n\nDoes the relationship between hard drug use and mental QOL differ based on adherence (irrespective of depression)?\n\n\nDoes the relationship between hard drug use and mental QOL differ based on depression (irrespective of adherence)?\n\n\nRemoving the confounder of depression in model 1 allows us to answer the main research question for this project.

While current users are in the midst of using hard drugs as a coping mechanism, and thus are protected from the negative impact of the treatment on mental QOL.\nThus, previous hard drug users are a vulnerable population, and high adherence to the treatment regiment might buffer them against the adverse effects of the HAART treatment.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the model predicting AGG_MENT_CHANGE, including only hard_drugs_grp and CESD_2, and their interaction term.\nThis addresses the confounding of depression on the relationship between hard drug use and change in mental QOL.\n\nAnalysisInterpretationVisualizing the Interaction\n\n\nCompare slopes for never users.\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp&lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Never User\")\n\n# Perform regression on mental QOL change by hard drugs group, full model\nmodel_MENT_sub1 &lt;- lm(AGG_MENT_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + CESD_2 + hard_drugs_grp*CESD_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\n# Examine the summary\nsummary(model_MENT_sub1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = AGG_MENT_CHANGE ~ hard_drugs_grp + CESD_2 + hard_drugs_grp * \n    CESD_2, data = data_wide_2)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-34.141  -6.071  -1.545   5.758  37.779 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                   Estimate Std.

However, the slope for depression on mental QOL did differ between previous and never hard drug users (t = -6.17, p-adjusted &lt; 0.0001). For each point increase in depression, the mental QOL score for previous hard drug users decreases an additional 0.80 points compared to never hard drug users (95% CI: -1.06 to -0.55).\nPrevious hard drug users have an increase of approximately 16.98 units in mental QOL, holding all other variables constant. This difference is statistically significant, suggesting that prior hard drug use is associated with a considerably higher outcome measure in this model.

However, this relationship is much stronger for previous hard drug users, where every 1 point increase in depression scores is associated with an almost 5x greater decrease in mental QOL score over 2 years (~1 point for previous users compared to ~0.2 points for current and never user).\nAnd most importantly the slopes differed significantly by hard drug use group, with previous hard drug users having an additional 0.8 or 0.9 greater decrease in mental QOL score compared to never and current hard drug users, respectively.\nThus, we used this relationship as further evidence that previous hard drug users are a vulnerable group. They are susceptible to losses in mental QOL if they have low adherence to the treatment regiment, and depression has a greater impact on the mental QOL of previous hard drug users compared to current and never hard drug users.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found a dual interaction where the impact of hard drug use on mental QOL depended on both adherence to the treatment regimen and depression.\nFor adherence, those with previous hard drug use had a decrease in mental QOL if and only if they had low adherence to the treatment regiment.\nFor depression, previous hard drug users had a larger decrease in mental QOL compared to never and current hard drug users.\nThus, we used both of these relationships as strong evidence that previous hard drug users are a vulnerable population. They are susceptible to losses in mental QOL if they have low adherence to the treatment regiment, and depression has a greater impact on their mental QOL compared to current and never hard drug users.\nThis finding has great clinical relevance for the treatment of HIV in hard drug users. Specifically, extra efforts should be made to help previous hard drug users in two ways: One, adherence appears to serve as a buffer for previous hard drug users in the relationship between hard drug use and mental QOL. Efforts to increase adherence should therefore be made to help patients receive this ameliorative effect. Two, previous hard drug users do not have the coping mechanism of heroin or opiates available to them to buffer against the impact of adverse effects from ART, and thus extra aid perhaps in the form of increased therapy should be provided to these patients to provide them with alternate coping strategies.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\nJust for completion’s sake, we can run a regression predicting depression score based on the interaction between hard drug use and adherence.\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp&lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$hard_drugs_grp, ref = \"Never User\")\n\n# Relevel to change to the reference group to never user\ndata_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW &lt;- relevel(data_wide_2$ADH_HIGHVSLOW, ref = \"Low Adherence\")\n\n# Perform regression on mental QOL change by hard drugs group, full model\nmodel_MENT_full1 &lt;- lm(CESD_2 ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW+ hard_drugs_grp*ADH_HIGHVSLOW, data = data_wide_2)\n\n# Examine the summary\nsummary(model_MENT_full1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = CESD_2 ~ hard_drugs_grp + ADH_HIGHVSLOW + hard_drugs_grp * \n    ADH_HIGHVSLOW, data = data_wide_2)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-15.679  -8.508  -2.508   6.492  38.492 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                                        Estimate Std.

Current hard drug users did not differ significantly from never hard drug users at low adherence (t = -2.35, p-adjusted =0.0574, 95% CI: -17.72 to -1.58), although with a larger sample size that could become significant.\n\n\nHard Drug Use at High Adherence\nAt high adherence, current hard drug users had on average a 3.94 point decrease in physical QOL compared to never hard drug users (t = -3.545, p-adjusted = 0.00128, 95% CI: -6.12 to -1.75), and 5.35 points decrease compared to previous hard drug users (t = 3.33, p-adjusted = 0.00279, 95% CI: 2.19 to 8.51). Additionally, previous hard drug users did not differ significantly from never hard drug users at high adherence (t = 1.100, p-adjusted = 0.815, 95% CI: -1.11 to 3.94).\n\n\n\nAdherence\nThe relationship between adherence and change in physical QOL over 2 years depended on hard drug use.\n\nAdherence for Current Hard Drug Users\nFor current hard drug users, those with high adherence had on average an 8.90 point increase in physical QOL compared to those with low adherence (t = 2.22, p = 0.027, 95% CI: 1.00 to 16.79).\n\n\nAdherence for Previous Hard Drug Users\nFor previous hard drug users, those with high adherence to the treatment regiment had on average a 15.49 point increase in physical QOL compared to those with low adherence (t = 4.56, p-adjusted &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: 8.82 to 22.17).\n\n\nAdherence for Never Hard Drug Users\nFor never hard drug users, those with high adherence had a 3.19 point increase in physical QOL compared to those with low adherence (t = 2.27, p = 0.0239).\n\n\n\nFrailty Related Phenotype\nFrailty related phenotype was a significant predictor of change in physical QOL over 2 years (t = -8.72, p &lt; 0.0001). On average, those with a frailty related phenotype had a 12.76 decrease in physical QOL compared to those without a frailty related phenotype (95% CI: -15.63 to -9.88).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nThe below plot is useful in interpreting the interaction.\n\n# Use interactions package to plot interaction\ncat_plot(\n  model_PHYS_final1, \n  pred = hard_drugs_grp, \n  modx = ADH_HIGHVSLOW, \n  geom = \"line\", \n  colors = \"Pastel2\",\n  x.label = \"Hard Drugs Group\",\n  y.label = \"Predicted Physical QOL Change\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those with low adherence, previous users had a greater decrease in physical QOL compared to never users. The difference between current and never hard drug users at low adherence is borderline significant, and may be so with a larger sample size.\nFor those with high adherence, the current hard drug use group had a greater decrease in physical QOL compared to both never and previous hard drug users.\nAnd most importantly, for previous hard drug users, those with low adherence had a decrease in physical QOL when compared to those with high adherence.\nWe take this as further evidence that previous hard drug users are at a vulnerable population. High adherence serves as a buffer and could protect patients that have quit heroin or opiates within the past 2 years.\nAdditionally, we have evidence that even at high adherence, current hard drug users have worse overall physical QOL."

    "text": "The aim of the current study is to assess how treatment response differs for HIV+ patients 2 years after initiating Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) based on hard drug usage (such as heroin or cocaine). This study is of particular scientific interest because it is unclear whether the use of hard drugs inhibits the immune system in humans; treatment strategies may differ based on these results. The researchers are interested in comparing subjects who never used hard drugs to current hard drug users (those that use hard drugs at year 2) or previous hard drug users (those who used drugs at year 0 or 1). Outcomes of interest are: viral load (HIV copies in a mL of blood), CD4+ T cell count (a measure of immunologic health), and aggregate physical and quality of life scores from the SF-36.\nThe clinical hypothesis is that, if hard drugs inhibit the immune system in humans, subjects who currently or previously used hard drugs will have higher viral load and lower CD4+ T cell counts than those who never used hard drugs. Additionally, the researchers are interested in knowing if potential differences between the drug use groups can be explained by differences in adherence to the treatment regimen. The researchers are agnostic on how quality of life changes after treatment, since side effects of the treatment are significant.\nThe project description provided by the PI is available below:"

    "text": "Project Description\n\nBackground\n             The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a MICU physical therapy (PT) quality improvement (QI) project on physical therapist practice, and quantify the changes in length of stay (LOS) and mechanical ventilation (MV) time. The goals of the QI Initiative were to increase percentage of MICU admissions receiving PT, decrease time from MICU admission to first PT, and increase the frequency of PT visits. The main question the researcher came to us with was: how to correctly model the longitudinal data in the study?\n\n\nStudy Design\n              This was a retrospective cohort study, comparing 3 main time periods: Pre-QI Initiative (before April 2015), During QI Initiative (April 2015-Dec 2015), and After-QI Initiative (Jan 2016 and later). The QI initiative was deployed during the 9-month period between April 2015 and December 2015, during which time there were education and staffing changes. Patients were stratified as either having mechanical ventilation or not having mechanical ventilation. The primary outcomes of interest were MICU LOS and time on MV. Secondary outcomes of interest were the non-ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and discharge location.\n\n\nDescription of the Data\n              Data was received as a de-identified .csv. Data points consist of: Admit and Discharge Time, PT Consult Time, Admit to Consult Time, First Therapy Time, Consult to Therapy Time, Admit to Therapy Time, Total Therapy Visits, Days with Therapy Visits, Average, min, and Max Therapy Length, Admit and Discharge Date/Time, Total MV Days, Hospital LOS, Patient Age, Sex, “Problem List”, and Codes (presumably ICD9/10).\n\n\nAnticipated Sample Size / Study Population\n              The sample size is N = ~3000-4000, consisting of patients admitted to the MICU with a LOS between 2 and 30 days (I.e. exclude &lt; 2 days or &gt; 30 days). This was a single site study performed here at Colorado University.\n\n\nHypothesis\n              The hypothesis for the study was that LOS and time on MV would decrease when comparing the pre- and intra-initiative time periods, and when comparing the pre- and post-initiative time periods. Clinical significance for this outcome is considered as a 1-2 day change in LOS. The intended end product of this project is a publication in a PT journal.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan (Sketch)\n              Data should first be examined for missingness, as this has not been performed. Similarly, repeat MICU admissions should be explored and controlled for to ensure independence of observations. Death during MICU stay should also be examined and adjusted for if needed. The analysis plan discussed was to utilize splines to capture the trajectory of LOS or time on MV over time by fitting smooth curves to the data. Linear contrasts should be performed to assess if there is a significant difference in LOS or time on MV when comparing two timepoints (i.e. pre- and intra-, pre- and post- , and post- and intra-QI Initiative. Supplementary analyses should be performed to assess secondary outcomes of interest of non-ICU LOS and total hospital LOS."

    "text": "Gabor Transform\n\nWhat is it\nThe Gabor Transform, named after Dennis Gabor, is a powerful technique for analyzing the texture of MRI images. By convolving the image with a Gabor filter, it becomes possible to discriminate between features based on intensity differences. This allows the target region and background to be differentiated if they possess distinct features, as they will exhibit different intensity levels. Moreover, the Gabor Transform has tunable parameters, such as the frequency of the sinusoidal wave, which can be adjusted to extract specific textures from the images. Higher frequencies are ideal for capturing fine textures, while lower frequencies are better suited for coarse textures.\n\n\nHow it Works\nThe Gabor Filter first applies a Gaussian Envelope to focus on a small region of the image. It then applies a sinusoidal wave that oscillates at a specific frequency and captures the variation in intensities at that frequency and orientation within that region.\n\n\nExample of Gabor Transform\n\n\n\nExample of applying a Gaussian, then Gabor, and Laplacian Filter (GGL) for differentiation between two different textures (+’s vs L’s) (2).\n\n\n\n\nImage Features Provided by the Gabor Transform\nIn general, Gabor functions can easily extract features of:\n\nSpatial Frequency (e.g. how often pixel intensity changes in a given area)\nDensity (e.g. concentration of features within a certain area)\nOrientation (e.g. Textures or edges at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°)\nPhase (e.g. alignment/distance of features)\nEnergy (e.g. overall intensity)\n\nSources: 1, 2"

GLCM works under the assumption that the textural information in an image is contained in the “average” spatial relationship that the gray tones in the image have to each other. For example, when a small patch of the picture has little variation of features, the dominant property is tone; When a small patch of a picture has high variation, the dominant property is texture (3).\n\n\nHow it Works\nGLCM examines the spatial relationship between pairs of pixels in an image and calculates how often pairs of pixel values occur at a specified distance and orientation. It does this by computing a set of gray-tone spacial-dependence matrices for various angular relationships and distances between neighboring resolution cell pairs on the image (3).\n\n\nExample of GLCM\n\n\n\nExample of textural features extracted from two different land-use category images (3).\n\n\n\n\nImage Features Provided by GLCM\nIn general, GLCM provides information on the following features:\n\nHomogeneity\nLinear Structure\nContrast\nNumber and Nature of Boundaries\nComplexity of the Image"

An important and fundamental property of texture is how uniform the patterns are, and LBP captures this by detecting these uniform patterns in circular neighborhoods at any rotation and spatial resolution. LBP is rotation invariant, meaning it does not matter what rotation the image is at; it will always extract very similar features) (4).\n\n\nHow it Works\nLBP works by comparing the intensity of a central pixel with its neighboring pixels and encoding this relationship into a binary pattern. For each neighbor, if it’s intensity is greater or equal to the central pixel, it gets assigned a 1 (otherwise a 0). The binary values of all neighbors are then concatenated to form a binary number, and this number is converted into a decimal that represent the LBP for the central pixel (4).\n\n\nExample of LBP\n\n\n\nExample of the 36 unique comparisons that can be made between neighboring pixels (4).\n\n\n\n\nCode Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Features Provided by the LBP\nIn general, the LBP provides image features on:\n\nUniformity\nLocal Contrast\nTexture Description\nSpatial Patterns\nGray Level Distribution"

Image features were extracted from the baseline MRI images including 2 image features on kidney geometric information, 5 features based on Gabor transform, 2 features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix, 5 features based on image textures, and 5 features based on local binary pattern.\n\nStatistical Hypotheses\n\nA linear regression model predicting percentage change of total kidney volume growth including MRI image features and baseline kidney volume will have better performance than a model with baseline kidney volume alone, as determined by specificity, sensitivity, PPV,  NPV,  accuracy, and AUC.\nA logistic regression model predicting classification of disease progression as slow or fast including MRI image features and baseline kidney volume will have better performance than a model with baseline kidney volume alone, as determined by specificity, sensitivity, PPV,  NPV,  accuracy, and AUC."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe differences in model performance for task one were not statistically significant. Model A had an RMSE that was 0.37 points higher than model B (p = 0.68), and 0.74 points higher than model C (p = 0.75). This may be due to small sample size however.\nThus, including MRI image features into the predictive model did not increase predictive capability above and beyond that of just using kidney volume measurements at baseline.\nOn the other hand, if it is true that a model with baseline kidney volume, a model with txti2 alone, and a model with both included all perform similarly at predicting percent change in kidney volume after 3 years, then this could provide support for predicting change in kidney volume percent by EITHER MRI image features or baseline kidney volume.\nThat is, utilizing MRI image features alone may offer similar predictive capabilities to using kidney volume measurements taken by a practiced physician. Therefore, if one is easier or cheaper than the other to acquire, the easier alternative could be used in place of the harder alternative and still achieve similar predictive power. For example, if there are MRI records but perhaps kidney volume measurements were not taken, then the MRI images can be used instead for making predictions."

However, this difference was not statistically significant.\nAdditionally, the model incorporating both txti2 and kidvol_base did not perform better than the model using just txti.\nHowever, examining the ROC curves and the 95% CIs for all of the models, it does appear that there is a trend towards these difference being significant. It is possible that these may have not been statistically significant due to a small sample size (N = 67)."

    "section": "Project Description",
    "text": "Project Description\n\nBackground\n             The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a MICU physical therapy (PT) quality improvement (QI) project on physical therapist practice, and quantify the changes in length of stay (LOS) and mechanical ventilation (MV) time. The goals of the QI Initiative were to increase percentage of MICU admissions receiving PT, decrease time from MICU admission to first PT, and increase the frequency of PT visits. The main question the researcher came to us with was: how to correctly model the longitudinal data in the study?\n\n\nStudy Design\n              This was a retrospective cohort study, comparing 3 main time periods: Pre-QI Initiative (before April 2015), During QI Initiative (April 2015-Dec 2015), and After-QI Initiative (Jan 2016 and later). The QI initiative was deployed during the 9-month period between April 2015 and December 2015, during which time there were education and staffing changes. Patients were stratified as either having mechanical ventilation or not having mechanical ventilation. The primary outcomes of interest were MICU LOS and time on MV. Secondary outcomes of interest were the non-ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and discharge location.\n\n\nDescription of the Data\n              Data was received as a de-identified .csv. Data points consist of: Admit and Discharge Time, PT Consult Time, Admit to Consult Time, First Therapy Time, Consult to Therapy Time, Admit to Therapy Time, Total Therapy Visits, Days with Therapy Visits, Average, min, and Max Therapy Length, Admit and Discharge Date/Time, Total MV Days, Hospital LOS, Patient Age, Sex, “Problem List”, and Codes (presumably ICD9/10).\n\n\nAnticipated Sample Size / Study Population\n              The sample size is N = ~3000-4000, consisting of patients admitted to the MICU with a LOS between 2 and 30 days (I.e. exclude &lt; 2 days or &gt; 30 days). This was a single site study performed here at Colorado University.\n\n\nHypothesis\n              The hypothesis for the study was that LOS and time on MV would decrease when comparing the pre- and intra-initiative time periods, and when comparing the pre- and post-initiative time periods. Clinical significance for this outcome is considered as a 1-2 day change in LOS. The intended end product of this project is a publication in a PT journal.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan (Sketch)\n              The next steps are to perform rigorous analyses on each outcome variable to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. We will perform a Poisson or Negative Binomial Regression with QI-initiative time period as the independent variable, and each respective outcome variable as the dependent variable, resulting in 7 individual models:\n\nLog( E(% of admissions receiving PTi | QI-Initiativei ) ) = β0 + β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Covariatesi + …\nLog( E(Time before First PTi | QI-Initiativei) ) = β0 + β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Covariates + …\nLog( E(Frequency of PT visitsi | QI-Initiativei) ) = β0 + β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Corvariatesi + …\nLog( E(Unit LOSi | QI-Initiativei ) ) = β0 + β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Covariatesi + …\nLog( E(MV Totali | QI-Initiativei ) ) = β0 + β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Covariatesi + …\nLog( E(Non-ICU LOSi | QI-Initiativei ) ) = β0 + β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Covariatesi + …\nLog( E(Hospital LOSi | QI-Initiativei ) ) = β0+ β1 * QI-Initiativei + β2 * Covariatesi + …\n\nPerforming these analyses as a Poisson or Negative Binomial Regression allows us to account for the right-skewness of these count variables. A Negative Binomial Regression will be performed in the case of overdispersion, where the variance is greater than the mean"

Odd that their missingness doesn’t align exactly. This isn’t actually too bad, and our sample size is large enough that we may still be able to include these variables in our analysis if we wanted to. We’d just have to do some processing to place patients into large enough overarching diagnosis categories that we’d have enough patients in each group. Not the researcher’s primary research question however so not looking any further into it. We’d also have to examine missingness and see if there are and patterns or it’s MCAR.\n\nSummary\nBased on the initial missingness checks, we will exclude variables with excessive missingness.\nThese variables will be retained for reporting in Table 1 for the researcher, but will be excluded from consideration in the analysis.\n\nConsult to Treat and Admit to Treat are missing &gt;= 55% of values, and will thus be excluded from analysis.\nProblem List DX Codes is missing 25% and Problem List DX Names is missing 20% of values. Additionally, it would be challenging to include these variables in the analysis in a meaningful way due to sample size limitations, so these will be excluded from consideration in the final analysis.\nAdmit to Consult is missing 23% of values.\n\nAll other variables were missing &lt; 1% and thus missingness does not need to be addressed for these variables."

I believe the variable we are actually interested in for MICU LOS is UNIT LOS however, so a range of 1 to1811 hours, or 0.41 to 75.46 days. (Just realized none of us asked for a data dictionary even though it was a room of ~20 stats master’s students 😅).\nThe researcher outlined the exclusion criteria of &lt; 2 days or &gt; 30 days in the MICU for her investigation. It looks like we will have to filter the data set to match these criteria.\nCONSULT TO TREAT has a range of -405 to 3056. ADMIT TO TREAT has a range of -1 to 983. I think these variables are the time from consultation or admission until the time treatment for that patient began. Again, without a data dictionary I am unsure what to make of those negative values.\nImportantly, AVG, MAX, and MIN THERAPY LENGTH all have negative values for the minimums. This doesn’t make any sense at face value, will have to investigate and circle back to the researchers for how this data was coded.\nSome variables like MV_Total are in hours, and some like DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS are in days. I don’t think we need to run any conversions, but this will be important to at least keep track of for interpretations.\nAside from that everything else looks coded properly."

Compared to patients in the Pre time period, patients in the During time period had a mean admit to treatment time that was 0.40 times that of patients in the Pre period (z = 23.80, 95% CI: [0.37, 0.43], p &lt; 0.0001), and patients in the Post time period had a mean admit to treatment time that was 0.51 times that of patients in the Pre period (z = -26.01, 95% CI: [0.48, 0.53], p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, compared to patients in the During time period, those in the Post time period had a mean admit to treatment time that was 1.26 times higher than that of patients during the During period (z = 6.37, 95% CI: [1.17, 1.35], p &lt; 0.0001), indicating a slight increase in admit to treatment time after the During period.\n\n\nAge\nAge was a significant predictor for time from admit to treatment, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and admission month. Compared to those who were 18-39, patients who were 50-59 had 0.91 times (z = -2.497, 95% CI: [0.84, 0.98], p = 0.0125), patients who were 60-69 had 0.81 times (z = -5.60, 95% CI: [0.75, 0.87], p &lt; 0.0001), and patients who were 70+ had 0.74 times (z = -7.70, 95% CI: [0.69, 0.80], p &lt; 0.0001) the admit to treatment time. Patients who were 40-49 did not have a statistically significant difference in admit to treatment time compared to those who were 18-39 (z = -0.97, 95% CI: [-.88, 1.04], p = 0.33).\n\n\nSeasonality\nAdmission Month was a significant predictor for admit to treatment time, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and age. For instance, those admitted during March had an admit to treatment time that was 0.80 times that of those admitted during January (z = -4.11, 95% CI: [0.71, 0.89, p &lt; 0.0001]).\nSince possible comparisons between months are myriad (12!), and the goal of this project was not to compare outcome variables between months (merely to control for these differences due to seasonality), further comparisons will not be made.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\nInitiative\n\n# Change reference level\ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"Pre\")\n\n# Fit a Negative Binomial model\nmodel_goal2_nb &lt;- glm.nb(`ADMIT TO TREAT` ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex)\n\n# Extract the effect for initiative\neffect_initiative &lt;- effect(\"initiative\", model_goal2_nb)\n\n# Convert the effect object to a data frame for ggplot\neffect_data &lt;- as.data.frame(effect_initiative)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(effect_data, aes(x = initiative, y = fit, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"aquamarine\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect of Initiative on Admit to Physical Therapy Wait Time\",\n    x = \"Initiative\",\n    y = \"Time from Admit to Physical Therapy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Range\n\n# Extract the effect for initiative\neffect_age &lt;- effect(\"Age_Range\", model_goal2_nb)\n\n# Convert the effect object to a data frame for ggplot\neffect_data &lt;- as.data.frame(effect_age)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(effect_data, aes(x = Age_Range, y = fit, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"aquamarine\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Age Range on Admit to Physical Therapy Wait Time\",\n    x = \"Age\",\n    y = \"Time from Admit to Physical Therapy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Extract the effect for initiative\neffect_month &lt;- effect(\"Month\", model_goal2_nb)\n\n# Convert the effect object to a data frame for ggplot\neffect_data &lt;- as.data.frame(effect_month)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(effect_data, aes(x = Month, y = fit, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"aquamarine\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Age Range on Admit to Physical Therapy Wait Time\",\n    x = \"Age\",\n    y = \"Time from Admit to Physical Therapy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\nQI-Initiative\nThe QI-initiative successfully decreased the wait time from admit to therapy, with patients admitted in the During period having a mean wait time that was 0.40 times that of patients in the Pre period (p &lt; 0.0001), and patients admitted in the Post period having a wait time that was 0.51 times that of patients in the Pre period (p &lt; 0.0001).\nAdditionally, there was a slight increase in wait time from admit to therapy after the QI-initiative, with those admitted in the Post time period having a mean wait time that was 1.26 times higher than that of patients during the During period (p &lt; 0.0001).\nThe QI-initiative effectively halved the wait time from admission to therapy!\n\n\nAge\nThere was an overall effect where patients that were 50 and older had an average admit to therapy wait time that was faster than patients who were 18-39. This indicates that patients who were 50 and older were being prioritized to receive physical therapy sooner.\n\n\nSeasonality\nThere were significant differences in wait time from admit to therapy based on the month the patient was admitted, likely just due to differences in staffing (such as in December and January), making this important that we included Admission Month as a covariate in our model that we controlled for.\nTop of Tabset"

Compared to patients in the Pre time period, the odds of receiving physical therapy in the During period were approximately 9.52 times higher (z = 18.144, 95% CI: [7.51, 12.22], p &lt; 0.0001), and the odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period were 4.84 times higher (z = 26.41, 95% CI: [4.31, 5.44], p &lt; 0.0001). The odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period were 0.51 the odds of receiving physical therapy in the during period (z = -5.35, 95% CI: [0.39,0.65], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nAge\nAge was a significant predictor for the likelihood of receiving PT, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and admission month. Compared to those who were 18-39, the odds of receiving physical therapy were 1.42 times higher for patients aged 50-59 (z = 4.04, 95% CI: [1.20, 1.69], p &lt; 0.0001), 1.91 times higher for patients aged 60-69 (z = 7.30, 95% CI: [1.60, 2.27], p &lt; 0.0001 ), and 2.15 times higher for patients age 70+ (z = 8.273, 95% CI: [1.79,], p = 2.58). The odds of receiving PT did not differ significantly between patients who were 18-39 and those who were 40-49 (z = 1.96, 95% CI: [1.00, 1.48], p = 0.0502).\n\n\nSeasonality\nAdmission Month was not a significant predictor for the likelihood of receiving PT (p’s for each month &gt; 0.5), but was included in the final model to account for potential seasonality effects.\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n# Change reference level\ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"Pre\")\n\n# Fit the logistic regression\nmodel_goal3 &lt;- glm(`PT_YN` ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex, family = binomial())\n\n# Plot effects\nplot(allEffects(model_goal3),\n     ylab = \"Likelihood of Receiving PT\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\nQI-Initiative\nThe QI-initiative was successful at increasing the likelihood that patients received physical therapy. Compared to patients in the Pre time period, the odds of receiving physical therapy in the During period were approximately 9.52 times higher (p &lt; 0.0001), and the odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period were 4.84 times higher (p &lt; 0.0001).\nAdditionally, there was a decrease in the likelihood of receiving PT after the During period, with the odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period being 0.51 the odds of receiving physical therapy in the during period (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nAge\nThere was an overall effect, where patients 50 years and older were more likely to receive PT compared to those 18-39 years old, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and admission month.\nThis is again evidence that older patients were receiving priority for PT.\nTop of Tabset"

    "text": "MICU Length of Stay\nThe primary question A of the study was whether the QI-initiative successfully decreased the MICU length of stay.\nTo assess this we will run a Poisson or Negative Binomial Regression model predicting UNIT LOS:\n\\(Log( E(MICU LOS | QI-Initiative_i ) ) = β_0 + β_1 * QI-Initiative_i + β2 *Covariates_i + ...\\)\n\nCovariatesModel SelectionAnalysisInterpretationVisualizationSummary\n\n\n\nCovariate Selection\nThe variables that were found to be correlated with MICU LOS were:\n\nHOSPITAL_LOS\nADMIT.TO.CONSULT\nPT_VISITS\nDAYS.WITH.THERAPY.VISITS\nAVERAGE THERAPY LENGTH\nMAX THERAPY LENGTH\n\nAVERAGE THERAPY LENGTH and MAX THERAPY LENGTH blank are just different ways of measuring the same variable, and thus only AVERAGE THERAPY LENGTH will be considered as a covariate because it is more relevant in the context of the study. AVERAGE THERAPY LENGTH is important to control for, because it gives us a final model demonstrating the impact of the QI-initiative time period, regardless of how long the therapy visits were for each patient.\nSimilarly, PT_VISITS and DAYS.WITH.THERAPY.VISITS are essentially the same variable, and thus only PT_VISITS will be selected because it was used in the previous analyses and is therefore more relevant. PT_VISITS will be imporant to account for because it will provide us with a model that demonstrates significance of the QI-initiative, regardless of how many PT visits each patient received.\nADMIT TO CONSULT will not be selected due to ~20% missinginess, and we do not want to exclude patients in this study that did not receive a consultation.\nHOSPITAL_LOS will not be include because it will be an outcome variable and will be analyzed in a separate model. Furthermore, MICU LOS is directly related to HOSPITAL_LOS, and I want to avoid redundant variables due to issues of collinearity (This would be akin to include BMI in a model predicting Height).\nAge_Range will be included to account for age and because it was a significant predictor in the previous 3 analyses.\nMonth will be included because we want to control for potential seasonality.\n\nInteraction Terms\nPreliminary visualization demonstrates that there may be a initiative*MV_YN*PT_YN interaction.

The relationship between QI-initiative and MICU length of stay depended on mechanical ventilation status.\n\nQI-Initiative for Non Mechanical Ventilation\nFor those who were not mechanically ventilated, patients admitted in the During period had a mean MICU length of stay that was 0.72 times that of patients admitted in the Pre period (z = -10.54, 95% CI: [0.68,0.76], p &lt; 0.0001), and patients admitted in the Post period had a mean MICU length stay that was 0.78 times that of patients admitted in the Pre time period (z = -12.49, 95% CI: [0.75, 0.81], p &lt; 0.0001). Those in the Post period had a mean MICU length of stay that was 1.09 times higher than patients during the During period (z = 2.78, 95% CI: [1.03,1.16], p = 0.00551).\n\n\nQI-Initiative for Mechanical Ventilation\nFor those who were mechanically ventilated, patients admitted in the During period had a mean MICU length of stay that was 0.57 times that of patients admitted in the Pre period (z = -17.55, 95% CI: [0.54,0.61], p &lt; 0.0001), and patients admitted in the Post period had a mean MICU length stay that was 0.68 times that of patients admitted in the Pre time period (z = -20.14, 95% CI: [0.65, 0.35], p &lt; 0.0001). Those in the Post period had a mean MICU length of stay that was 1.18 times higher than patients during the During period (z = 5.60, 95% CI: [1.12,1.25], p &lt; 0.0001 ).\n\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation\nMechanical ventilation was a significant predictor of MICU length of stay, while controlling for age, admission month, reception of physical therapy, and the number of physical therapy visits. The relationship between Mechanical Ventilation and MICU length of stay differed based on the QI-initiative time period.\n\nMechanical Ventilation in the Pre-Initiative Period\nFor those in the Pre period, patients who were mechanically ventilated had a mean MICU length of stay that was 1.79 times greater than patients who were not mechanically ventilated (z = 31.451, 95% CI: [1.73, 1.86], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation in the During-Initiative Period\nFor those in the During period, patients who were mechanically ventilated had a mean MICU length of stay that was 1.43 times greater than patients who were not mechanically ventilated (z = 9.141, 95% CI: [1.32, 1.54], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nMechanical Ventilation in the Post-Initiative Period\nFor those in the Post period, patients who were mechanically ventilated had a mean MICU length of stay that was 1.55 times greater than patients who were not mechanically ventilated (z = 23.09, 95% CI: [1.49, 1.61], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nAdditional Interaction Comparisons\nThere are additional comparisons we can make in the interaction between initiative and mechanical ventilation, but they pose little clinical relevance and will thus not be examined further (e.g. no mechanical ventilation and Pre period vs mechanical ventilation and Post period).\n\n\n\nAge Range\nWhen accounting for multiple pairwise comparisons, age range is not a significant predictor of MICU length of stay while controlling for the other variables in the model (all p’s &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nAdmission Month\nWhen accounting for multiple pairwise comparisons, admission month is not a significant predictor of MICU length of stay while controlling for the other variables in the model (all p’s &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nPhysical Therapy\nReception of physical therapy was a signicant predictor of MICU length of stay, when controlling for the other variables in the model. Patients who received physical therapy had a mean MICU length of stay that was 1.09 times greater than those who did not receive physical therapy (z = 5.40, 95% CI: [1.05, 1.12], p = &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nPhysical Therapy Visits\nNumber of physical therapy visits was a significant predictor of MICU length of stay, when controlling for the other variables in the model. On average, each 1 visit increase was associated with a 1.14 times increase in MICU length of stay (z = 44.23, 95% CI: [1.13,1.15], p &lt; 0.0001).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(interactions)\n\n# Change levels for optimal plot\ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"During\")\ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"Pre\")\n\n# Fit a Negative Binomial model\nmodel_MICU &lt;- glm.nb(Unit_LOS ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month + PT_VISITS + MV_YN + initiative*MV_YN + PT_YN, data = data_ex)\n\n# Use interactions package to plot interaction\ncat_plot(\n  model_MICU, \n  pred = initiative, \n  modx = MV_YN, \n  geom = \"line\", \n  colors = \"Pastel2\",\n  x.label = \"QI-Initiative Time Period\",\n  y.label = \"Predicted MICU Length of Stay\",\n  main.title = \"MICU Length of Stay by QI-Initiative Time Period and Mechanical Ventilation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot Differences between Mechanical Ventilation Status\n\n# Relevel for proper output\ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"During\")\ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"Pre\")\n\n### this is from chat gpt\n# Create a new data frame for predictions\nnew_data &lt;- data_ex %&gt;%\n  expand.grid(\n    initiative = unique(data_ex$initiative),\n    MV_YN = unique(data_ex$MV_YN),\n    Age_Range = unique(data_ex$Age_Range),\n    Month = unique(data_ex$Month),\n    PT_VISITS = mean(data_ex$PT_VISITS, na.rm = TRUE),\n    PT_YN = unique(data_ex$PT_YN)\n  )\n\n# Predict using the model\nnew_data$predicted_LOS &lt;- predict(model_MICU, newdata = new_data, type = \"response\")\n\n# Summarize the differences\nnew_data_summ &lt;- new_data %&gt;% group_by(initiative, MV_YN) %&gt;% \n  summarize( mean_LOS = mean(predicted_LOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(diff_LOS = mean_LOS - lag(mean_LOS)) %&gt;% na.omit()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'initiative'.

On average, those were mechanically ventilated in the Pre period had a predicted MICU length of stay that was 86.39 hours more than those were not, compared to only 33.69 hours in the During period, and 47.02 hours in the Post period.\nIn other words, the QI-initiative decreased the average MICU length of stay by at least 48 hours for those who were mechanically ventilated!\nTop of Tabset"

Compared to patients in the Pre time period, patients in the During time period had a mean mechanical ventilation time that was 0.66 that of those in the Pre period (z = -9.12, 95% CI: [0.60, 0.72], p &lt; 0.0001), and patients in the Post time period had a mean mechanical ventilation time that was 0.78 that of those in the pre period (z = -9.08, 95% CI: [0.74,0.82], p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, compared to patients in the During time period, those in the Post time period had a mean mechanical ventilation time that was 1.18 that of those in the During period (z = 3.92, 95% CI: [1.09, 1.29], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nAge\nAge was not a significant predictor in this model (all p’s &gt; 0.5), but was included in the final model to control for it.\n\n\nMonth\nAdmission Month was a significant predictor for mechanical ventilation time, while controlling for QI-initiative time period, age, total PT visits, and average PT visit length. For instance, those admitted during March had an average mechanical ventilation time that was 0.88 times that of those admitted during January z = -2.294, 95% CI: [0.79,0.98], p = 0.022).\nSince possible comparisons between months are myriad (12!), and the goal of this project was not to compare outcome variables between months (merely to control for these differences due to seasonality), further comparisons will not be made.\n\n\nReception of Physical Therapy\nReception of physical therapy was a signicant predictor of mechanical ventilation time, when controlling for the other variables in the model. Patients who received physical therapy had a mean mechanical ventilation time that was 1.15 times greater than those who did not receive physical therapy (z = 2.95, 95% CI: [1.11, 1.13], p = 0.003).\n\n\nTotal Physical Therapy Visits\nNumber of physical therapy visits was a significant predictor of mechanical ventilation time, when controlling for the other variables in the model. On average, each 1 visit increase was associated with a 1.12 times increase in mechanical ventilation time (z = 25.13, 95% CI: [1.11,1.13], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nAverage Physical Therapy Length\nAverage physical therapy length was a significant predictor of mechanical ventilation time, when controlling for the other variables in the model.

There was no difference in the mean Non-ICU length of stay between the Pre and During period (z = -0.84, 95% CI: [0.84, 1.07], p = 0.40), between the Pre and Post period (z = -1.51, 95% CI: [0.88, 1.02], p = 0.13), or between the During and Post periods (z = -0.093, 95% CI: [0.88, 1.12], p = 0.93).\n\n\nAge\nAge range was a significant predictor of non-ICU length of stay, while controlling for the other variables in the model. Specifically, patients who were 70+ had a mean non-ICU length of stay that was 0.76 that ofpatients who were 13-39 (z = -5.130, 95% CI: [0.68, 0.84], p &lt; 0.0001). Other age comparisons were not significant (p &gt; 0.05), and comparisons with baseline categories besides 13-39 were not conducted.\n\n\nAdmission Month\nAdmission Month was a significant predictor for non-ICU length of stay, while controlling for the other variables in the model. For instance, those admitted during May had an average mechanical ventilation time that was 0.78 times that of those admitted during January (z = -2.52, 95% CI: [0.69, 0.96], p = 0.01).\nSince possible comparisons between months are myriad (12!), and the goal of this project was not to compare outcome variables between months (merely to control for these differences due to seasonality), further comparisons were not made.\n\n\nNumber of Physical Therapy Visits\nNumber of physical therapy visits was a signifcant predictor of non-ICU length of stay. On average, every one visit increase was associated with a 1.08 times higher non-ICU length of stay (z = 9.63, 95% CI: [1.06,1.10], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nReception of Physical Therapy\nReception of physical therapy was a significant predictor of non-ICU length of stay. On average, patients who received physical therapy had a mean non-ICU length of stay that was 1.19 times higher than patients who did not (z = 4.08, 95% CI: [1.09,1.29], p &lt; 0.0001).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n# Relevel \ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"Pre\")\n\n# Run the model\nmodel_NON &lt;- glm.nb(NON_ICU_LOS ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month + PT_VISITS + PT_YN, data = data_ex, link = log)\n\n# Extract the effect for initiative\neffect_plot &lt;- effect(\"initiative\", model_NON)\n\n# Convert the effect object to a data frame for ggplot\neffect_data &lt;- as.data.frame(effect_plot)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(effect_data, aes(x = initiative, y = fit, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"aquamarine\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Non-ICU Length of Stay by QI-Initiative Time Period\",\n    x = \"QI-Initiative\",\n    y = \"Non-ICU Length of Stay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of Tabset\n\n\nWe can conclude that the QI-initiative was not successful in reducing Non_ICU length of stay. Which makes sense, as physical therapy likely targets the patients in worse condition that could benefit from it compared to patients admitted for more benign injuries.\nTop of Tabset"

Compared to those in the Pre period, patients in the During period had a mean total hospital length of stay that was 0.83 times that of patients in the pre period (z = -5.27, 95% CI: [0.77,0.89], p &lt; 0.0001), and patients in the Period had a mean total hospital length of stay that was 0.86 times that of patients in the Pre period (z = -7.10, 95% CI: [0.82,0.89], p &lt; 0.0001). Those who were admitted in the During period did not have a significantly different total hospital length of stay compared to those enrolled in the Post period (z = 0.92, 95% CI: [0.96, 1.10], p = 0.36).\n\n\nAge\nAge range was a significant predictor of total hospital length of stay, while controlling for the other variables in the model. Specifically, patients who were 50-59 had 0.94 times (z = -2.16, 95% CI: [0.88, 0.99], p = 0.031), patients who were 60-69 had 0.94 times (z = -2.03, 95% CI: [0.89, 0.99], p = 0.043), and patients who were 70+ had 0.82 times the total hospital length of stay of patients who were 13-39 (z = -6.23, 95% CI: [0.77, 0.87], p = 0.0001). Patients who were 40-49 did not differ significantly from patients who were 13-39 (p = 0.37).\n\n\nAdmission Month\nAdmission Month was a significant predictor for total hospital length of stay, while controlling for the other variables in the model. For instance, those admitted during May had an average total hospital length of stay that was 0.86 times that of those admitted during January (z = -3.19, 95% CI: [0.78, -0.0578866], p = 0.0014).\nSince possible comparisons between months are myriad (12!), and the goal of this project was not to compare outcome variables between months (merely to control for these differences due to seasonality), further comparisons will not be made.\n\nNumber of Physical Therapy Visits\nTotal number of physical therapy visits was a significant predictor of total hospital length of stay, while controlling for the other variables in the model. On average, each 1 visit increase was associated with a 1.10 times increase in total hospital length stay (z = 19.37, 95% CI: [1.08, 1.11], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nAverage Physical Therapy Length\nAverage physical therapy length was a significant predictor of total hospital length of stay, while controlling for the other variables in the model. On average, each 1 minute increase in average physical therapy visit length was assocaited with a 1.004 times increase total hospital length of stay (z = 8.03, 95% CI: [1.003, 1.006], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nReception of Mechanical Ventilation\nReception of mechanical ventilation was a signicant predictor of total hospital length of stay. On average, patients who were mechanically ventilated had a mean total hospital length of stay that was 1.19 times greater than those who were not (z = 8.79, 95% CI: [1.14, 1.23], p &lt; 0.0001).\nTop of Tabset\n\n\n\n\n\n# Relevel \ndata_ex$initiative &lt;- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = \"Pre\")\n\n# Get rid of spaces\ndata_ex &lt;- data_ex |&gt; \n  mutate(HOSPITAL_LOS = `HOSPITAL LOS`)\n\n# Run the model\nmodel_tot &lt;- glm.nb(HOSPITAL_LOS ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month + PT_VISITS + AVG_THERAPY_LENGTH + MV_YN, data = data_ex, link = log)\n\n# Extract the effect for initiative\neffect_plot &lt;- effect(\"initiative\", model_tot)\n\n# Convert the effect object to a data frame for ggplot\neffect_data &lt;- as.data.frame(effect_plot)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(effect_data, aes(x = initiative, y = fit, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"aquamarine\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Total Hospital Length of Stay by QI-Initiative Time Period\",\n    x = \"QI-Initiative\",\n    y = \"Total Hospital Length of Stay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop of Tabset\n\n\nThe QI-initiative was successful at reducing the total hospital length of stay!\nQI-initiative time period was a significant predictor of total hospital length of stay, while controlling for age, admission month, mechanical ventilation, total physical therapy visits, and average therapy length.
